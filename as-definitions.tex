\item {\large force \& motion}

\begin{compactitem}
	
\item \emph{resultant/net force}: a single force that has the same effect as all forces combined
	
\item \emph{Newton's first law (law of inertia)}: an object stays at rest or moves with constant velocity if there is no resultant force
	
\item \emph{Newton's second law}: acceleration of an object is proportional to resultant force, and inversely proportional to its mass ($F_\text{net}=ma$)

\item \emph{Newton's third law/action-reaction principle}: action and reaction are of the same type, act with equal magnitude in opposite directions

\item \emph{equilibrium of forces}: resultant force is zero (in case of two forces acting , they are equal but opposite; in case of three forces, they form a closed vector triangle)

\item \emph{weight}: a force of gravity due to gravitational attraction by the earth, always acting downwards

\item \emph{distinguish between mass and weight}: mass is an intrinsic property of object which does not change with location, has no direction; weight is a force of gravity which depends on the gravitational field, acts towards centre of planet

\item \emph{acceleration of free fall}: in absence of air, acceleration of falling objects/projectiles is constant and always points vertically downwards

\item \emph{free fall in air}: as speed of falling object increases, air resistance increases, so net force decreases, so acceleration gradually decreases to zero, speed tends to constant

\item \emph{terminal speed}: when air resistance is in equilibrium with weight of falling object, it falls with constant speed called the terminal speed

\item \emph{motion of object sliding down an inclined slope}: acceleration produced by component of weight along the slope (subtract friction if surface is not smooth) ($mg\sin\theta - f = ma$)

\item \emph{torque of a couple}: one force of the pair $\times$ perpendicular distance between the two forces

\item \emph{centre of gravity/mass}: point at which entire weight of an object can be considered to act

\item \emph{conditions for mechanical equilibrium}: no resultant force, and no resultant torque/moment

\item \emph{principle of moments}: sum of all clockwise moments is equal to sum of all anticlockwise moments about any point

\item \emph{kinetic energy}: energy possessed by an object due to motion

\item \emph{conservation of energy}: energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only transform from one form into another, total amount of energy is constant for any closed system

\item \emph{energy changes for object sliding down a slope}: loss in potential energy equals gain in kinetic energy plus work down against friction

\item {\large superposition of waves}

\begin{compactitem}
	
\item \emph{principle of wave superposition}: when two waves meet/overlap, resultant displacement is the sum of displacements of each individual
	
\item \emph{condition for constructive superposition}: peak meets peak; phase difference between two waves $\Delta \phi = 0, 2\pi, 4\pi, \dots$; path difference $\Delta L = 0, \lambda, 2\lambda, \dots$

\item \emph{condition for destructive superposition}: peak meets trough; phase difference between two waves $\Delta \phi = \pi, 3\pi, 5\pi, \dots$; path difference $\Delta L = \frac{1}{2}\lambda, \frac{3}{2}\lambda, \frac{5}{2}\lambda,  \dots$

\item \emph{monochromatic light}: light of single wavelength/frequency

\item \emph{diffraction}: as wave passes through a narrow slit/gap/obstacle, it bends and spreads out

\item \emph{increase effect of diffraction}: increase wavelength or reduce size of slit, greatest diffraction when wavelength is close to width of slit

\item \emph{coherence}: wave sources have constant phase difference (at any time)

\item \emph{how an interference pattern is formed}: when two coherent waves meet and superimpose, stable regions of constructive superposition are formed at points where $\Delta \phi = 0, 2\pi, 4\pi, \dots$ or $\Delta L = 0, \lambda, 2\lambda, \dots$, maxima are observed

\item \emph{condition for interference}: two waves overlap/meet together, waves are of same type, sources are coherent

\item \emph{double-slit experiment}: coherent light passes through two narrow slits and meet at screen, alternating bright and dark fringes are observed, fringe separation is given by $x=\frac{\lambda D}{d}$, where $d$ is separation between slits and $D$ is slit-to-screen distance (also see \emph{interference})

\item \emph{effect of increasing width of slit}: intensity of emergent light increases if slit is made wider, so bright fringes become brighter; if width of both slits are increased together, still have complete cancellation, so dark fringes remain dark

\item \emph{diffraction grating}: light incident on a system of many close slits to produce spectra by interference, angle $\theta$ of $n^\text{th}$ order maxima is given by $d\sin\theta = n\lambda$, where $d$ is separation between neighbouring slits

\item \emph{passing white light through diffraction grating}: all wavelengths have zero path difference at $\theta=0$, so $0^\text{th}$ order is white; to produce $1^\text{st}$ order, longer wavelength needs larger path difference, red/violet has maxima at greater/smaller angle, $1^\text{st}$ order is a continuous spectrum

\item \emph{how a stationary wave is formed}: two progressive waves travelling in opposite directions meet and superimpose, if they are of same frequency and wave speed, they form a stationary wave (stable regions of constructive and destructive interference)

\item \emph{node}: point that has zero displacement

\item \emph{anti-node}: point that vibrates with greatest amplitude

\item \emph{differences between progressive wave and stationary wave}: progressive wave can transfer energy, stationary wave cannot; amplitudes of different points in a progressive wave are the same, but phase difference can be different; amplitudes of different points in a stationary wave can be all different, but phase difference is either 0 or $\pi$

\item \emph{measuring wavelength using stationary waves}: send wave towards a reflector, adjust position of reflector until a point with zero intensity is found, then slowly move the detector until the next minima, distance $d$ moved out is the node-to-node distance, so wavelength $\lambda = 2d$

\item \emph{e.m.f. of a supply/battery}: energy gain by unit positive charge as it moves though the battery

\item \emph{distinguish between p.d. and e.m.f.}: p.d. across a resistor/component is amount of electrical energy converted into other forms (heat, light, mechanical, etc.) per unit charge, e.m.f. of a cell is amount of electrical energy converted from other forms (chemical, nuclear, mechanical, etc.) per unit charge

\item \emph{resistance}: ratio of potential difference to electric current ($R=\frac{V}{I}$)

\item \emph{factors that determine resistance}: resistance is proportional to length of conductor, inversely proportional to cross sectional area, and also depends on material ($R=\frac{\rho L}{A}$)

\item \emph{ohmic conductor}: resistance remains constant as p.d./current varies, $I$-$V$ characteristic graph is a straight light through origin

\item \emph{resistance of metallic conductors at larger currents}: increasing current produces more heating effect, higher temperature causes resistance of metal to increase

\item \emph{Kirchhoff's first law}: for any point in a circuit, sum of currents flowing into that point equals sum of currents flowing out

\item \emph{Kirchhoff's second law}: for any closed loop in a circuit, sum of all e.m.f.'s of supplies equals sum of all p.d. drops across components

\item \emph{Kirchhoff's laws and conserved quantities}: first law is related to charge conservation, second law is related to energy conservation

\item \emph{properties of components connected in series}: same current / p.d. is shared

\item \emph{properties of components connected in parallel}: same p.d. / current is shared

\item \emph{why terminal p.d. is less than e.m.f.}: as current flows through a cell, there exist lost volts in internal resistance, so terminal p.d. falls

\item \emph{internal resistance of a cell}: ratio of lost volts to current through cell

\item \emph{p.d. across a variable resistor in a potential divider circuit}: as variable resistor $R_v$ increases, current decreases, p.d. across fixed resistor $R_0$ increases, so p.d. across $R_v$ decreases
