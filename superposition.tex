\section{Superposition of Waves}

When two of more waves meet together, the resultant motion is a combination of the individuals. They can form a \emph{resultant wave} when they overlap, after which they cross one another and neither is affected. In this chapter, we will study the principle of superposition, and look at two important consequences: the phenomenon of \emph{interference} and \emph{stationary waves}.

\subsection{superposition of waves}



\subsubsection{principle of superposition}

\begin{ilight}
	 when two (or more) waves meet to form a resultant wave, the \keypoint{principle of superposition} states that the resultant displacement is the vector sum of each individual displacement
\end{ilight}

\example{Displacementâ€“time graphs for two waves $A$ and $B$ meeting at some point, together with the resultant wave formed at that point.}

\cmt two important situations are constructive superposition and destructive superposition

\cmt \keypoint{constructive superposition} occurs when resultant wave has greatest possible amplitude
	
	this happens when peaks of the two waves meet together (also trough meets trough)\footnote{This statement is implicitly for transverse waves. For longitudinal waves to superpose constructively, the regions of compression (or rarefaction) must overlap.}
	
	peaks of both waves must arrive with a time difference $\Delta t = 0, \, T, \, 2T, \cdots$
	
\cmt \keypoint{destructive superposition} occurs when amplitudes of each wave cancel out one another
	
	this happens when peak of one wave overlaps with trough of the other wave
	
	peaks of both waves must arrive with a time difference $\Delta t = \frac{1}{2}T, \, \frac{3}{2}T, \, \frac{5}{2}T, \cdots$

\subsubsection{path difference}

one way to compare how much peaks of two waves differ is using the \keypoint{path difference}

when two waves meet at a point, each wave travels a distance from its source

the difference between distances travelled by the two waves is the path difference $\Delta L$

\cmt we can tell whether two waves superpose constructively or destructively by path difference

so destructive superposition, resultant amplitude is small, sound is quiet \eoe




\subsubsection{phase difference}

when two waves or two vibrating particles are compared, it is also useful to describe how much one is out of step with the other in terms of their \keypoint{phase difference} ($\Delta \phi$)
\footnote{More logically, we should first define the notion of \emph{phase angle} before talking about the \emph{phase difference}, which is simply the difference between the phase angles of two waves.
	
	Wave motion can generally be described by sine (or cosine) functions. Since the initial displacement of a wave is not necessarily zero, one can introduce a constant term that appears in the argument of the sine function. This term shifts the origin of the sine, and we call that the \emph{phase angle} $\phi$ of the wave, measured in radians (or degrees). One can think of $\phi$ as a number giving the fraction in a complete oscillation.
	
	In particular, the displacement $y$ of a transverse wave along the direction $x$ of energy transfer can be given by: $y = A \sin\left( \frac{2\pi x}{\lambda} - \frac{2\pi t}{T} + \phi \right)$. You can verify that this indeed describes a sinusoidal wave of wavelength $\lambda$ and period $T$ travelling at speed $v = \frac{\lambda}{T}$, while $\phi$ determines when and where the peaks show up.}

\cmt phase difference is measured in radians (rad) or degrees ($^\circ$)

\cmt if two waves have a phase difference $\Delta \phi = 0,2\pi,4\pi,\cdots$, the two waves are said to be \keypoint{in phase}\footnote{If $\Delta \phi$ is given in degrees, then two waves are in phase if $\Delta \phi = 0, \, 360^\circ, \, 720^\circ, \cdots$}

in this case, peak of one wave overlaps with peak of the other

\cmt if two waves are not in phase, then they are said to be \keypoint{out of phase}

\cmt if $\Delta \phi = \pi, 3\pi, 5\pi, \cdots$, then two waves are completely out of phase, or \keypoint{anti-phase}\footnote{If $\Delta \phi$ is given in degrees, then two waves are anti-phase if $\Delta \phi = 180^\circ, \, 540^\circ, \, 900^\circ, \cdots$}

in this case, peak of one wave meets the trough of the other


\cmt we can tell whether two waves superpose constructively or destructively by phase difference

\subsubsection*{brief summary}

conditions for constructive and destructive superposition can be summarised as follows:

\begin{center}
{\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.25}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	& constructive superposition & destructive superposition \\
	\hline
	simple criteria & peak meets peak & peak meets trough \\
	\hline
	time difference & $\Delta t = n \cdot T$ & $\Delta t = \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot T$ \\
	\hline
	path difference & $\Delta L = n \cdot \lambda$ & $\Delta t = \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \lambda$ \\
	\hline
	phase difference & $\Delta \phi = n\cdot 2\pi\,$ or $\,n\cdot 360^\circ$ & $\Delta \phi = \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\cdot 2\pi \,$ or $\,\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\cdot 360^\circ$ \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
}
\end{center}

where $n$ is a whole number: $n=0, 1, 2, 3 \cdots$

remember that $\Delta t$, $\Delta L$ and $\Delta \phi$ are just different ways to describe how much one wave is ahead of/lag behind another wave, so they must be closely interrelated to each other






\subsection{interference}

\subsubsection{interference}

when two (or more) waves of constant phase difference meet, stable regions of constructive and destructive superposition are produced alternately, this phenomenon is called \keypoint{interference}\index{interference}

\end{figure}

\cmt regions of constructive interference are often called \emph{maxima}

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] points on line C$_0$ are of equal distance to wave sources, i.e., path difference $\Delta L = 0$
	
	so maxima are observed along C$_0$
	
	\item[--] points on C$_1$, C$_2$ and C$_3$ have path difference $\Delta L = \lambda, \, 2\lambda, \, 3\lambda, \cdots$
	
	so maxima are also formed along C$_1$, C$_2$ and C$_3$
	
	\item[--] equivalently, points on C$_n$ have phase difference $\Delta \phi = n\cdot 2\pi$, where $n=0,1,2,3,\cdots$
\end{compactitem} 

\cmt regions of destructive interference are often called \emph{minima}

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] points on D$_1$, D$_2$ and D$_3$ have path difference $\Delta L = \frac{1}{2}\lambda, \, \frac{3}{2}\lambda, \, \frac{5}{2}\lambda, \cdots$
	
	so maxima are also formed along D$_1$, D$_2$ and D$_3$
	
	\item[--] similarly, points on D$_n$ have phase difference $\Delta \phi = \left( n+\frac{1}{2} \right) \cdot 2\pi$, where $n=1,2,3,\cdots$
\end{compactitem} 






\newpage


\cmt stable interference means regions of maxima/minima remain maxima/minima

this requires \keypoint{coherent} wave sources, which means constant phase difference over time

\cmt coherent waves usually come from same source, such as

\cmt interference are not observed for beams of light from different lamps or laser sources

this is because light from different sources are usually \emph{incoherent}\footnote{Emission of light is associated with the electronic transitions between energy levels in an atom, which is a completely random process. So in general separate light sources are not coherent.}

this can be overcome by dividing a single beam into several beams using a number of slits

common apparatuses of doing so are the \emph{double-slit} and \emph{diffraction gratings}

\example{Two coherent waves meet in space, one of which has an amplitude of 0.30 cm and the other of 0.20 cm. How does the intensity of maxima compare with the intensity of minima?}

\sol amplitude of maxima: $A_\tmax = A_1 + A_2 = 0.30 + 0.20 = 0.50 \text{ cm}$

amplitude of minima: $A_\tmax = A_1 - A_2 = 0.30 - 0.20 = 0.10 \text{ cm}$

ratio of intensities: $\frac{I_\tmax}{I_\tmin} = \left( \frac{A_\tmax}{A_\tmin} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{0.50}{0.10} \right)^2 \RA \frac{I_\tmax}{I_\tmin} = 25$ \eoe

\subsubsection{double-slit interference}\index{double-slit experiement}

let's take a beam of light being guided through two narrow slits

light waves diffracting through the slits act as coherent wave sources

when they meet on a screen, interference pattern can be seen

since this experiment is carried out with light, alternating bright and dark fringes are formed

this is known as \emph{Thomas Young}'s \keypoint{double-slit experiment}
\footnote{The nature of light has been argued since the history of human civilisation. It has been long debated whether light is a \emph{wave} or it is made of \emph{particles}. It was until the early 1800s when Thomas Young carried out the famous double-slit experiment that now bears his name, people became certain that light has wavelike properties. For a more detailed review, see the Wikipedia article: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light}.}

\noindent \textbf{proof}: consider a point $P$ on the screen where a bright fringe is formed (see graph)

path difference between the slits must be a whole number of wavelength: $ \Delta L = \big|PB-PA\big| = n\lambda $

since $D \gg d$, paths $PA$ and $PB$ can be considered approximately parallel

so path difference is length of the segment $HB$, then we have: $\Delta L \approx d\sin\theta$

in terms of $\theta$, bright fringes are found where: $ d\sin\theta = n\lambda $

to convert $\theta$ into the coordinate $y$, we have: $\tan \theta = \frac{y}{D}$

but $\theta$ is very small, small-angle approximation ($\sin \theta \approx \tan \theta$) can be applied

so positions where the bright fringes show up are: $ y_n =  n \times \frac{\lambda D}{d} $

here the coordinate subscript $n$ labels the order of the bright fringes

this shows that the $(n+1)$-th fringe is at a constant distance from the $n$-th fringe

therefore separation between neighbouring bright fringes is $ {x=\frac{\lambda D}{d}} $ \eoe

\cmt altering width of slit could cause a change in \emph{brightness} of fringes

width of slit determines intensity of emergent light passing through that slit

resultant amplitude will be affected as a consequence of the superposition principle

\example{The teacher demonstrates the double-slit experiment with a beam of red light produced from a helium-neon laser. The beam of wavelength of 632 nm is sent through a double-slit separated by 0.30 mm and passed onto a wall at about 2.0 m from the slits. (a) What is the fringe separation? (b) If the experiment is carried out using a green laser, what changes do you expect?}

\sol fringe separation: $ x = \frac{\lambda D}{d} = \frac{632 \times 10^{-9} \times 2.0 }{0.30 \times 10^{-3}} \RA x \approx 4.2 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}$

if replaced by green light, wavelength becomes shorter, so smaller fringe separation \eoe


\example{Coherent light passes through a double slit. Initially, the light intensity from each slit is the same. State the change to the appearance of the fringes if (a) the separation between the slits is increased, (b) The width of one of the slits is reduced.}

\sol (a) from $ x = \frac{\lambda D}{d} $, shorter $\lambda$ results in smaller fringe separation

\hspace*{1.25em} but brightness of the fringes remains unchanged

(b) reducing width of slit causes amplitude of light from that slit to decrease

\hspace*{1.25em} at maxima, resultant amplitude decreases, so bright fringes become less bright

\hspace*{1.25em} at minima, amplitudes do not cancel completely, so dark fringes become a bit brighter

\hspace*{1.25em} but no change to separation between fringes \eoe



\subsubsection{multi-slit interference: diffraction gratings}

passing light through even more slits also produces nice interference patterns

\keypoint{diffraction grating} is such an apparatus, with hundreds or thousands of slits per mm\index{diffraction grating}

\noindent\textbf{proof} for constructive interference, path difference between adjacent slits must satisfy: $\Delta L = n\lambda $

since slits are so close together, light rays passing through the slits are nearly parallel

using the same trick as before, we obtain: $d \sin \theta = n\lambda$

this is known as the \emph{diffraction grating equation}.



\cmt greatest angle through which a beam of light can be diffracted is 90$^\circ$

this puts a constraint on the highest order possible:
\begin{equation*}
n_\tmax = \frac{d\sin\theta_\tmax}{\lambda} < \frac{d \sin 90^\circ}{\lambda} \RA \boxed{n_\tmax < \frac{d}{\lambda}}
\end{equation*}

the value of $\frac{d}{\lambda}$ should be rounded \emph{down} to the nearest whole number to give $n_\tmax$

\cmt if white light is passed through diffraction gratings, \emph{dispersion} is observed

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] at zeroth order, diffraction grating equation $d\sin\theta_0 = 0\cdot\lambda$ is satisfied at $\theta_0 = 0$ for any $\lambda$
	
	so at central maxima we observe a collection of all colours, i.e., a white central maxima
	
	\item[--] at first order, $d\sin\theta_1 = 1\cdot\lambda$, maxima for long wavelengths appear at greater angles
	
	spectrum spreads into a rainbow band, with red light at outer end and violet closer in
	
	\item[--] at higher orders, dispersion would be more spread out 
	
	the spectra of different orders may even overlap to give complicated combinations
	
	we do not intend to discuss this further
\end{compactitem}

\cmt diffraction grating is an import device in analysis of light

it is widely used in measurement of wavelength of light

\example{Light of 632 nm wavelength produces first-order maxima at 16$^\circ$ when passing through a diffraction grating at right angles. How many lines per millimetre are there in the diffraction grating?}

\sol slit separation: $d = \frac{n\lambda}{\sin\theta} = \frac{1\times632\times10^{-9}}{\sin 16^\circ} \RA d \approx 2.29 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$

number of lines in 1 mm: $N = \frac{1 \text{ mm}}{2.29 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-3}}{2.29 \times 10^{-6}} \RA N \approx 436$ \eoe

\example{Green light of 510 nm wavelength is incident normally on a diffraction grating with slit separation of 2.0 $\mu$m. (a) What is the highest order seen? (b) how many maxima are produced? (c) If blue light is used for the same diffraction grating experiment, suggest the effect on the diffraction pattern.}

\sol to find highest order, we have: $n_\tmax < \frac{d\sin 90^\circ}{\lambda} = \frac{2.0\times10^{-6}}{510\times10^{-9}} \approx 3.9 \RA n_\tmax = 3$

1st, 2nd, 3rd-order on either side and 0th-order at centre, so $ 2\times 3 + 1 = 7$ maxima are formed

blue light has shorter wavelength, so more maxima will be produced with blue light, and separation between each maxima would be closer \eoe

\example{Light of wavelength 630 nm produces a second-order maxima at angle of $60^\circ$ when it is directed at a diffraction grating. If visible light of another wavelength can also give a maximum at the same angle, what is this wavelength?}

\sol using diffraction grating equation: $d \sin\theta = n\lambda$, we find $n\lambda$ is constant for fixed $\theta$

from information given in the question, this constant is $ 2\times630 = 1260 \text{ nm}$

if $n=1$, $\lambda = 1260 \text{ nm}$, which would be infra-red

if $n=3$, $\lambda = 420 \text{ nm}$, which would be visible (violet)

if $n\geq 4$, $\lambda \leq 315 \text{ nm}$, which would be ultraviolet

so the desired wavelength is 420 nm \eoe







\subsection{stationary waves}

\subsubsection{formation of stationary waves}

stationary waves are often formed when a travelling wave is \emph{reflected} at a some point

forward-moving wave and backward-moving reflected wave combine to form stationary wave

\begin{ilight}
	when two waves of same frequency and same speed travel in opposite directions and meet together, they superpose to form stable regions of constructive and destructive interference, this forms a \keypoint{stationary wave}, also known as a \keypoint{standing wave}\index{stationary wave}
\end{ilight}

\lambda_1 = 2L \qquad \lambda_2 = L \qquad \lambda_3 = \frac{2L}{3} \qquad \cdots \qquad \lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}
\end{equation*}

making comparison with the fundamental wavelength $\lambda_1$ $\lambda_1$, we have
\begin{equation*}
\lambda_2 = \frac{\lambda_1}{2} \qquad \lambda_3 = \frac{\lambda_1}{3} \qquad \cdots \qquad \lambda_n = \frac{\lambda_1}{n}
\end{equation*}

\cmt since wave speed remains constant as wave travels through the same medium

frequency of each mode is inversely proportional to its wavelength, hence,  
\begin{equation*}
f_2 = 2f_1 \qquad f_3 = 3f_1 \qquad \cdots \qquad f_n=n f_1
\end{equation*}

\sol five loops so five half-wavelengths $\RA L = \frac{5}{2}\lambda \RA \lambda = \frac{2}{5}L = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 \RA \lambda = 32\text{ cm}$

to have larger wavelength, one could do either of the following:

\titem use a string with greater length (while keeping frequency of oscillator unchanged)

\titem reduce the frequency of oscillation (constant wave speed, so $\lambda$ increases)

\titem increase tension in string (wave speed increases for same frequency, so $\lambda$ increases) \eoe




\subsubsection*{stationary wave between one fixed end and one open end}

in this case, we have a node at one end and an anti-node at the other end

	\caption*{arrangement of apparatuses for setting up a stationary sound wave}
\end{figure}

\cmt to set up a stationary sound wave, we need two travelling waves in opposite directions

sound wave can be produced by a \emph{loudspeaker} (coupled to \emph{signal generator})

this forward-travelling wave is reflected at a \emph{metal plate}

reflected wave superposes with wave from loudspeaker to give a stationary wave

wave intensity can be detected by a \emph{microphone} and observed on an \emph{oscilloscope}

\cmt to verify whether stationary wave is formed, we check whether nodes are formed

positions of the metal plate and the microphone are adjusted carefully

if there exists a location where no signal is detected, this means microphone is at a node

now a stationary wave has been formed between loudspeaker and reflector

\cmt to find wavelength of sound wave, we slowly move microphone to next node

wavelength of sound wave: $\lambda = 2\times \text{distance between neighbouring nodes}$

\cmt to find frequency of sound wave, we move microphone to anywhere except the nodes

from time base of the oscilloscope, we can work out period $T$ of the wave

frequency is then given by the formula: $f=\frac{1}{T}$

\cmt finally,  speed of the sound wave\footnote{We should bear in mind that stationary waves do not propagate through space, so rigorously speaking, it is incorrect to say the speed of a stationary way. The wave speed calculated in this way refers to the speed of either of the two travelling waves that give rise to the stationary wave through superposition.} can be calculated: $v=\lambda f$




\subsubsection{stationary waves \& progressive waves}

there are quite a few differences between a stationary wave and a progressive wave

\cmt progressive wave can transfer energy from one place to another

but for stationary waves, vibrational energy is not transferred due to existence of nodes

\cmt different points in general have different amplitudes over a stationary wave

\hspace*{1.25em} nodes have zero amplitude, anti-nodes have greatest amplitudes

\hspace*{1.25em} other points have various amplitudes depending on their positions

but for a progressive wave, all points have the same amplitude

\hspace*{1.25em} displacements of each point at a particular moment can be all different

\hspace*{1.25em} but the largest displacements they can reach are the same (if no loss of energy)

\cmt phase difference between any two points in a progressive wave can take any value

\hspace*{1.25em} different points reach their peaks at different times for a progressive wave

\hspace*{1.25em} so $\Delta \phi$ can be anything from 0 to $2\pi$ (or anything from 0 to $360^\circ$)

\cmt phase difference between any two points in a stationary wave is either 0 or $\pi$ (or $180^\circ$)

\hspace*{1.25em} for points between adjacent nodes, they all reach their highest at same time

\hspace*{1.25em} despite differences in amplitudes, these points are all in phase, so $\Delta \phi=0$

\hspace*{1.25em} for points separated by one node, they are anti-phase

this is because when one is at its peak, the other is at its trough, so $\Delta \phi = \pi$ (or $180^\circ$)
