\section{Electrical Quantities \& Components}

\subsection{electrical quantities}

\subsubsection{electric charges}

electric charge is the property of matter that causes it to experience a force in an electric field

electric charges come in two types, \emph{positive} charges (+ve) and \emph{negative} charges (-ve)

you should be familiar that like charges repel each other, while opposite charges attract

interaction between electric charges plays a central role in electrical phenomena

\cmt electric charges are measured in coulombs: $[Q] = \text{C}$

\cmt all matter is made of atoms, which consist of a nucleus (+ve) and electrons (-ve)

each electron has a charge of $-e$, where $e=1.60\times10^{-19}\text{ C}$ is the \keypoint{elementary charge}

\cmt a body becomes electrically-charged by losing or gaining electrons

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] an object that gains electrons from elsewhere becomes negatively-charged
	
	\item[--] an object that loses electrons becomes positively-charged
\end{compactitem}


\cmt an object can only lose or gain a whole number of electrons

charge of any object must be an integer multiple of the elementary charge: $Q=Ne$

we say the charge of an object is \keypoint{quantised}

\cmt electric charges cannot be created from nowhere nor be destroyed

charges can be transferred from one object to another, but the total amount is constant

this is a law of conservation, known as the \keypoint{conservation of electric charges}


\example{A metal sphere carries a net charge of $+2.4 \times 10^{-9} \text{ C}$. Suggest whether the sphere has gained additional electrons or lost electrons, and also calculate how many electrons has the sphere gained or lost?}

\sol the sphere is positively-charged, so it has lost some of its electrons

number of lost electrons: $ N = \frac{Q}{e} = \frac{2.4\times10^{-9}}{1.60 \times10^{-19}} \RA N = 1.5 \times 10^{10}  $ \eoe



\subsubsection{electric current}

flow of electric charges gives rise to electric currents

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{electric current} $I$ is defined as the amount of charge flow $Q$ per unit time: $ \boxed{I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}} $\index{current}
\end{ilight}


\cmt unit of electric current: $[I] = \text{A}$ (ampere)

note that ampere is one of the S.I. base units\footnote{A current of 1 A is defined as the following: when two parallel infinitely-long straight wires separated by a distance of 1 m carry two equal currents such that the force per metre between them is $2.0\times10^{-7}$N, then this current is of 1 A.}\footnote{It might sound strange to you that the notion of electric current is defined based on electric charge, but the unit of charge is defined based on the unit of current: 1 C = 1 A s. Sometimes physicists are like nuts.}

\cmt direction of a current is defined as the direction of flow of positive charges

but current flowing in a conductor is usually due to motion of negatively-charged electrons

so conventional current is in opposite direction to the electron flow

\cmt to find charge flow from a current, we can use  $Q=It$ if this is a constant current

if the current varies with time, area under the $I$-$t$ graph can give the charge flow

or one can also seek to find the average current and then proceed with $Q=\bar{I}t$

\cmt current in a circuit can be measured with an \keypoint{ammeter}

\example{A current of 25 mA flows in a wire. How many electrons have passed a point in the wire in one hour?}

\sol charge flow: $Q = I t = 25\times10^{-3} \times 3600 \RA Q = 90 \text{ C}$

number of electrons: $N = \frac{Q}{e} = \frac{90}{1.60 \times10^{-19}} \RA N \approx 5.6 \times 10^{20}$ \eoe

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.35\textwidth}

	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[yscale=0.6]
		\draw[thick,blue] (0,1) -- (3,4);
		\draw[<->] (0,5) node[left]{$I$/A} -- (0,0) node[left]{0} -- (3.75,0) node[below]{$t$/s};
		\node[left] at (0,1) {2.0};

		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-5pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

\example{The current in a lamp is increased uniformly from 2.0 A to 8.0 A over 3.0 s. What is the charge flow?}

\sol average current during this time is: $\bar{I} = \frac{2.0+8.0}{2} = 5.0 \text{ A} $

charge flow is then: $ Q = \bar{I} t = 5.0 \times 3.0 = 15 \text{ C} $

we can also use area under $I$-$t$ graph
\begin{equation*}
	Q = \frac{1}{2} \times (2.0 + 8.0) \times 3.0 = 15 \text{ C} \teoe
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection*{microscopic view of electric currents}

flow of electric current is essentially due to motion of charge carriers\footnote{In most metallic conductors, charge carriers are those \emph{free electrons}. Charge carriers can also be positively-charged \emph{holes} in some semi-conductors or \emph{ions} in chemical solutions.}

naively, current would depend on number of charge carriers and how fast they move

let's take cross section $A$ of a material, and see what determines the electric current



\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
	\draw[fill=orange!40, opacity=0.4] (5,-1) arc(-90:90:0.5 and 1) -- (2,1) arc(90:270:0.5 and 1) -- (5,-1);
	\draw[thick] (0,0) ellipse (0.5 and 1) node {$A$};
	\draw[dashed] (2,0) ellipse (0.5 and 1);
	\draw[thick] (0,-1) -- (5,-1) arc(-90:90:0.5 and 1) -- (0,1);
	\foreach \x/\y in {0.6/-.3, 0.9/0.5, 0.8/-0.7, 1.8/0.1, 2.6/0.6, 2.9/-0.5, 3.6/0.4, 4.1/-0.7, 4.4/0.1, 4.3/0.6}{
	\draw[->] (\x, \y) --++ (0.4,0);% node[above]{$v$};
	\shade[ball color = green] (\x, \y) circle (0.08);
	}
	\draw[thick, ->] (1.5,1.6) -- (3.5, 1.6) node[midway, above] {$I$};
	\draw[<->] (2,-1.6) -- (5,-1.6) node[above, midway]{$\Delta L = v \Delta t$};
	\draw (4.9, 0.75) --++ (0.7,0.6) node[above right]{$\Delta V$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}



let's define $n$ being the number density of charge carriers for the material

then total number $N$ of charge carriers in a volume $V$ can be given by: $N = nV$

if each carrier has a charge of $q$ and moves with a speed $v$, then they contribute to a current:
\begin{equation*}
	I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta N q}{\Delta t} = \frac{n \Delta V q}{\Delta t} = \frac{n A \Delta L q}{\Delta t} = \frac{n A v \Delta t q}{\Delta t} \RA \boxed{I = nAvq}
\end{equation*}

\cmt for metals, free electrons act as charge carriers, the equation becomes: $I = nAve$

\cmt charge carriers have a distribution of speeds as they flow

so $v$ is actually an average velocity, called the \emph{mean drift velocity}

\cmt $n$ is number density of charge carriers, whose value depends on type of material

good conductors have large $n$, while semiconductors have smaller $n$


\example{A length of silver wire of a diameter of $1.2 \text{ mm}$ carries a current of 2.0 A. The electron number density in silver is $5.9\times10^{28} \text{ m}^{-3}$. What is the mean drift velocity of the electrons?}

\solc\begin{equation*}
v = \frac{I}{nAe} = \frac{I}{n\cdot\frac{1}{4} \pi d^2 \cdot e} = \frac{2.0}{5.9\times10^{28} \times \frac{1}{4}\pi \times (1.2\times10^{-3})^2\times1.60\times10^{-19}} \approx 1.9\times10^{-4} \mps
\end{equation*}

this calculation shows that each free electron actually travel at very low speeds in a wire \eoe

\example{A metal conductor and a piece of semi-conductor of the same cross section are connected in series. When an electric current is driven through them, compare the mean drift speed of the charge carriers in the two materials.}

\sol same current and same cross section, so mean drift speed $ v = \frac{I}{nAe} \propto \frac{1}{n}$

metal has larger $n$, so free electrons move at relatively lower speeds

semi-conductor has smaller $n$, so charge carriers move at relatively higher speeds \eoe




\subsubsection{p.d. \& e.m.f.}\label{ch:potential-difference}

p.d. and e.m.f.\footnote{e.m.f. stands for \emph{electromotive force}, which is a miserably misleading term due to historical reasons. It has nothing to do with a force. It is better to simply use the abbreviation e.m.f.} are both defined as the energy transfer per unit charge

both terms are often called \emph{voltages} in less formal contexts

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{p.d. (potential difference)} between two points is the energy needed to move a unit positive charge from one point to the other: $\boxed{V=\frac{W}{Q}} $ \index{potential difference}
\end{ilight}

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{e.m.f. (electromotive force)} of a power supply is the energy needed to move a unit positive charge around a complete circuit: $\boxed{\mathcal{E}=\frac{W}{Q}} $ \index{e.m.f.}
\end{ilight}


\cmt unit of measurement for p.d./e.m.f.: $[V] = [\mathcal{E}] = \text{V}$ (volt), where $1 \text{ V} = 1 \text{ J C}^{-1}$

\cmt p.d. differs from e.m.f. mainly due to the forms of energy transfer involved

p.d. is amount of electrical energy transferred \emph{into} other forms (heat, light, mechanical, sound, etc.) per unit charge across a component (resistor, lamp, motor, etc.)

e.m.f. is amount of electrical energy transferred \emph{from} other forms (chemical, mechanical, wind, nuclear, etc.) per unit charge in a power supply (battery, generator, etc.)

\cmt p.d. can tell direction of current flow through a component

current always flows from a higher potential to a lower potential

\cmt p.d. across a component can be measured with a \keypoint{voltmeter}


\example{How much electrical energy is transformed into thermal energy when a charge of 10 C flows through a heater whose p.d. across is 25 V?}

\solc\begin{equation*}
	V = \frac{W}{Q} \RA W = V Q = 25 \times 10 = 250 \text{ J} \teoe
\end{equation*}

\example{A fully-charged 12 V car battery can supply a total electrical energy of 0.90 MJ. The starter motor of the car requires an average current of 150 A for a period of 2.0s. The battery is not able to recharge due to a fault. How many times can the starter motor be used?}

\sol total charge can be supplied: $Q_\text{total} = \frac{W}{\mathcal{E}} = \frac{0.90 \times 10^6}{12} = 75000 \text{ C}$

charge needed for each start: $Q = I t = 150 \times 2.0 = 300 \text{ C}$

number of starts possible: $N = \frac{Q_\text{total}}{Q} = \frac{75000}{300} = 250$ \eoe




\newpage

\example{Electrons beams are accelerated between a heated cathode and an anode with a potential difference of 40 V. What is the speed of the electrons when they reach the anode?}

\sol electrical potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy of electrons:
\begin{equation*}
qV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \RA v=\sqrt{\frac{2qV}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \times 40}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}}} \approx 3.75 \times 10^6 \mps \teoe
\end{equation*}




\subsubsection{resistance}

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{resistance}\index{resistance} $R$ of an electrical component is defined as the potential difference across divided by the current flowing through it: $ \boxed{R=\frac{V}{I}} $
\end{ilight}


\cmt unit of resistance: $ [R] = \text{V A}^{-1} = \Omega $ (ohm)

when a p.d. of 1 V is applied and current flow is 1 A, then resistance is 1 $\Omega$

\cmt resistance of a component does not depend on p.d. applied or current through it

\cmt resistance $R$ of a component mainly depends on the following factors:

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] $R$ is proportional to length $L$ of the component: $R \propto L$
	
	\item[--] $R$ is inversely proportional to cross-sectional area $A$ : $R \propto \frac{1}{A}$
	
	\item[--] $R$ depends on the material of the component
\end{compactitem}

this can be written as: $ \boxed{R=\rho\frac{L}{A}} $

the constant $\rho$ is called the \keypoint{resistivity}\index{resistivity} of the material

\cmt typical value of resistivity for a conducting metal: $\rho \sim 10^{-8} \text{ } \Omega \text{ m}$


\example{A current of 0.10 A is driven through a heater when connected to a supply voltage of 220 V. (a) Find the resistance of the heater. (b) If the heater is made from a wire of resistivity $1.8\times10^{-5} \text{ }\Omega\text{ m}$ and a diameter of 0.24 mm, find the length of the wire.}

\solc\begin{equation*}
	R = \frac{V}{I} = \frac{220}{0.10} \RA R = 2200 \text{ }\Omega
\end{equation*}
\vspace*{-1.2em}\begin{equation*}
R = \frac{\rho L}{A} \RA L = \frac{RA}{\rho} = \frac{2200 \times \pi \times (0.12\times10^{-3})^2}{1.8 \times 10^{-5}} \RA L \approx 5.5 \text{ m} \teoe
\end{equation*}

\example{A uniform wire of resistance $R$ has a length of $L$ and a cross-sectional area of $A$. If the wire is stretched to twice the length while its volume remains constant, what is the new resistance $R'$ in terms of $R$?}

\sol volume: $V=LA = \text{constant}$, so $A \propto \frac{1}{L}$, hence doubling $L$ means $A$ would become halved

\vspace*{0.3em} resistance: $R = \frac{\rho L}{A} \propto \frac{L}{A} \RA \frac{R'}{R}  = \frac{L'}{L} \times \frac{A}{A'} = 2 \times 2 \RA R' = 4R $ \eoe

\subsubsection{electrical power}

current flowing through any electrical component transforms electrical energy into other forms

rate at which electrical energy is transferred, or electrical power, is computed as
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta  t} \xlongequal{V=\frac{W}{Q}} \frac{\Delta Q \cdot V}{\Delta t} \xLongrightarrow{I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}} \boxed{P=IV}
\end{equation*}

substituting $V=IR$, formula for electrical power also takes two alternative forms
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{P=I^2 R} \quad \text{or} \quad \boxed{P=\frac{V^2}{R}}
\end{equation*}

\cmt unit for electrical power: $[P] = \text{W}$ (watt)

if a p.d. of 1 V drives a current of 1 A, power produced is 1 W, i.e., $1 \text{ W} = 1 \text{ A} \cdot 1 \text{ V}$



%\example{An electric toaster has a power rating of 900 W and current of 4.0 A. What is the resistance in the toaster?}
%
%\solc\begin{equation*}
%	P = I^2 R \RA R = \frac{P}{I^2} = \frac{900}{4.0^2} \RA R \approx 56 \text{ }\Omega \teoe
%\end{equation*}



\example{An electric toaster is labelled `220V 900 W'. When it is working normally, find (a) the current through it, (b) the resistance in the toaster.}

\sol current: $I = \frac{P}{V} = \frac{900}{220} \RA I \approx 4.09 \text{ A}$

\vspace*{0.3em} resistance: $R = \frac{V}{I} = \frac{220}{4.09}$, $\,\,$ or alternatively, $R = \frac{V^2}{P} = \frac{220^2}{900} \RA R \approx 53.8 \text{ }\Omega$ \eoe

\example{Two conducting cylinders $X$ and $Y$ are of the same diameter and the same material. The length of the cylinder $X$ is twice of that of the cylinder $Y$. If the two cylinders are connected in series to a power supply so that the current through them are equal, find the ratio of the electrical powers dissipated in the two cylinders $\frac{P_X}{P_Y}$.}

\sol for either cylinder, electrical power: $P = I^2 R = I^2 \cdot \frac{\rho L}{A} = I^2 \cdot \frac{4 \rho L}{\pi d^2}$

same current $I$, same diameter $d$, same resistivity $\rho$, so power: $P \propto L \RA	\frac{P_X}{P_Y} = \frac{L_X}{L_Y} = 2 $ \eoe



\subsection{electrical components \& $I$-$V$ characteristics}

different components behave differently when a p.d. is applied

the behaviours can be shown in an $I$-$V$ characteristics graph


\subsubsection{ohmic conductors}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.28\textwidth}
	\vspace*{-20pt}
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
	\draw[->] (0,-3) -- (0,3) node[left]{$I$};
	\draw[->] (-4,0) -- (4,0) node[below]{$V$};
	\draw[thick, blue] (-3.6,-2.7) -- (3.6, 2.7);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\vspace*{-16pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

resistance of an ohmic conductor is constant for all currents

so current is directly proportional to p.d.


\cmt metals wires are usually considered as ohmic conductors

resistance of metal wires is nearly constant at fixed temperature

\cmt resistance of ohmic conductor equals inverse of the gradient



\subsubsection{lamp filaments}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.28\textwidth}
	\vspace*{-10pt}
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
	\draw[->] (0,-3) -- (0,3) node[left]{$I$};
	\draw[->] (-4,0) -- (4,0) node[below]{$V$};
	\draw[thick, blue] (0,0) -- (1, 1.2) [out=50.2, in=190] to (3.6,2.7);
	\draw[thick, blue] (0,0) -- (-1, -1.2) [out=230.2, in=10] to (-3.6,-2.7);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\vspace*{-16pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

lamp filaments are usually made from tungsten

for small currents, filament behaves like an ohmic component

for larger currents, filaments are heated to high temperature\footnote{This is because the vibration of the metal lattice would increase as the temperature goes up, free electrons are more likely to be scattered, so the metal becomes less conductive, the current does not increase as much for the same p.d. increase.}

resistance of filament would increase as $V$ or $I$ increases

\cmt to find resistance of lamp filament, we read off values of $I$ and $V$, then the ratio $\frac{V}{I}$ (instead of inverse of gradient) gives resistance

\subsubsection{thermistors}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.28\textwidth}

		\draw[thick] (0,0) to [thR,l_=$R_T$] (3,0);
	\end{circuitikz}
\end{wrapfigure}

\keypoint{thermistor}\index{thermistor} has a resistance that varies with temperature

as temperature rises, resistor of thermistor becomes lower\footnote{In A-Levels, we consider \emph{NTC (negative temperature coefficient)} thermistors only. This means their resistance decreases as temperature rises. There also exist \emph{PTC (positive temperature coefficient)} thermistors, but let's pretend they don't exist in this course.}\footnote{The behaviour of thermistors can be explained in terms of band theory of solids, about which you are going to learn at A2 level. To put it in simple words, we can say that electrons are bound to atoms and cannot move freely at low temperatures, but they can gain energy and break free from atoms if temperature goes up. There are more free electrons available to conduct electricity, so resistance decreases.}

at greater currents, current increases more for same p.d. increase

\cmt to find resistance of thermistor, we also compute the ratio $\frac{V}{I}$

	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}


\cmt a practical semiconductor diode become conductive once p.d. reaches a set value $V_\text{th}$

this value is called the diode's \emph{threshold voltage} (about $0.6\sim0.7$ V for a silicon diode)

when p.d. applied is forward-biased and greater than $V_\text{th}$, diode has very low resistance

so there is a sharp increase in current once $V>V_\text{th}$

\cmt a practical diode has very high resistance if reversed-biased

but if reverse voltage reaches the \emph{breakdown voltage}, diode would become conductive\footnote{Typical breakdown voltage for a diode range from a few volts to several hundred volts, depending on its desired application.}

	From the calculations, we find that the drift speed of electrons in metal wires is around a few mm per second, so it would take a very long time for the free electrons to travel a distance of a few metres in an electric circuit. But when we switch on an electric lamp, it lights up immediately. Give a reason for this observation.
