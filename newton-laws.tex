\section{Force \& Motion}

\subsection{force \& motion: an introduction}

in physics, a force appears when two bodies interact with one another

\cmt you will encounter various types of forces in this course, some of which are

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] \emph{weight}: the gravitational attraction acting on any object exerted by the earth
	
	\item[--] \emph{tension}: a force in a string, a rope, a chain, etc. when it is being pulled
	
	\item[--] \emph{normal contact}: when a body's surface is compressed, there reacts a normal contact force\footnote{Examples of normal contact force are support force that stops a desk from sinking into the ground, and the impact on a football when you kick it, etc.}
	
	\item[--] \emph{friction}: a force that resists relative motion when two surfaces tend to slide over one another
	
	\item[--] \emph{resistance}: also called drag force, this is experienced when a body travels through a medium

	
	\item[--] \emph{upthrust}: an upward force acting on an object immersed in a fluid
	
	\item[--] \emph{electric force}: an attractive or repulsive interaction between electrically charged objects
	
%	\item[--] \emph{magnetic force}: an attractive or repulsive interaction between magnets or electric currents
\end{compactitem}

detailed features of these forces follow later in the notes.

\cmt a force can produce various effects to the object, the effect could be

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] an increase/decrease in speed
	
	\item[--] a change in the direction of motion
	
	\item[--] causing the object to rotate
	
	\item[--] a change in shape of the object
\end{compactitem}

in this and the next few chapters, we will be looking into each of these aspects

\cmt when more than one force act on a body, it is useful to find their \emph{resultant}, or the \emph{net force}

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{resultant force}, or \keypoint{net force}, is a single force that has the same effect as all forces acting on an object combined
\end{ilight}

\emph{vector sum} of all of the individual forces gives the resultant force

\cmt in this chapter, we will study the dynamics of \emph{point masses}

\keypoint{point mass} is an idealization that the object has a mass but does not take up any space

position of an object treated as a point mass is specified with a geometric point in space

this is a simplification when size, shape, rotation, or structure of object are not important




\subsection{Newton's laws of motion}\index{Newton's laws of motion}

Newton's laws of motion\footnote{These three laws were first addressed by \emph{Isaac Newton} in his famous work \emph{Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy}, or simply the \emph{Principia}. The three-volume work was first published in 1687, and was soon recognised as one of the most important works in the history of science. Apart the from the three laws that laid the foundations for classical mechanics, the \emph{Principia} also stated \emph{the law of gravitation}, and accounted for planetary orbits and tides and other phenomena.} are three laws that form the basis of classical mechanics

they describe the relationships between motion of an object and forces acting on it


\subsubsection{first law}

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{Newton's first law} states that an object continues in its state of rest or uniform motion at constant velocity if there is no resultant force acting
\end{ilight}


\cmt any object `dislikes' any change to its state of motion, uniform motion tends to persist forever

this tendency to resist changes in motion is called the \keypoint{inertia}

Newton's first law is also called \emph{the law of inertia}

\cmt if there is no change in state of motion, the object is said to be in \keypoint{equilibrium}\index{equilibrium}

equilibrium could be either \emph{static} (being at rest) or \emph{dynamic} (steadily moving in a straight line)

both cases require zero resultant force

\cmt Newton’s law of inertia is placed to establish frames of reference

it is in an reference frame that notions of displacement, velocity and acceleration can be defined

an \keypoint{inertial reference frame} is one in which Newton’s laws hold
\footnote{Inertial frame is not unique. An observer moving at constant velocity to an inertial observer is in a different inertial frame, since constant velocity of object added to a constant relative velocity is still a constant velocity. Two inertial observers would disagree on a body's velocity, but they would agree that the body maintains its velocity in absence of net force, i.e., they will observe the same physics phenomena. This is known as the \emph{equivalence principle}.}

%\begin{example}{Suspension of a slinky}
%	If a slinky is freely suspended, one notices that the degree to which the slinky is stretched increases uniformly with height.
%	
%	Since the slinky is in a state of rest, all net force is cancelled throughout the entire slinky, i.e., the tension at any point balances the weight of the slinky beneath it. So the higher it goes, the more weight is supported, so the top bit has to be stretched more to provide a greater tension to hold the bottom part.
%\end{example}


\subsubsection{second law}

if resultant force is non-zero, velocity of the object will change, i.e., force produces acceleration


\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{Newton's second law} states that the acceleration is proportional to the resultant force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object
\end{ilight}

\cmt symbolically, we write $a \propto \frac{\fnet}{m}$

with consistent units of measure, this proportionality can be written as an exact equation:
\begin{equation}
a=\frac{\fnet}{m} \quad \text{or} \quad \boxed{\fnet=ma}
\end{equation}

\cmt SI unit of measurement for force $F$ is \keypoint{newton} (N)

a force of one newton acting a body of 1 kg produces an acceleration of 1 $\mpss$

\cmt note that the force in the equation $F=ma$ is the resultant force

to determine change in motion for a body, you should always ask what the resultant force is

\cmt acceleration produced is always in same direction of the net force

\cmt for same force, an object of greater mass has a smaller acceleration

hence mass is a measure of the \emph{inertia} of this object in response to a net force\index{inertia}

a definition for mass of an object from the point of view of Newton's laws can be stated as\footnote{The concept of mass can be defined in many different ways. You might be familiar with the definition for mass as the amount of matter an object possesses. I personally think this definition is a bit vague and does not tell you anything new. Thinking of mass as a measure of inertia surely brings more insights. Mass also tells the strength at which an object interacts with other bodies through the gravitational attraction. As you will see later, from the view of Albert Einstein, it is also possible to think of mass as a form of energy, which is my favourite definition for mass.}:

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{mass} is an intrinsic property of a body to resist any change in its state of motion
\end{ilight}

\example{A box of 6.0 kg is being pushed along a horizontal surface with a force of 30 N. The resistive force acting is 21 N. What is the acceleration of the box?}

\solc\begin{equation*}
	\fnet = F - f = ma \RA a = \frac{F-f}{m} = \frac{30-21}{6.0} = 1.5 \mpss \teoe
\end{equation*}

\example{A car of mass 800 kg is travelling at a speed of $20 \mps$. The driver then operates the brake pedal so a braking force of 2000 N gradually brings the car to stop. (a) What is the deceleration for the car? (b) What is the stopping distance?}

\sol using Newton's second law and noticing braking force acts opposite to direction of motion:

{
	\centering
	
	$\fnet = ma \RA -2000 = 800 \times a \RA a = -2.5 \mpss$
	
	$2as = v^2 - u^2 \RA s = \frac{v^2-u^2}{2a} = \frac{0^2 - 20^2}{2\times(-2.5)} = 80\text{ m}$
	
}

\example{A massive ball is suspended on a string. A second string is attached to the bottom of the ball. If one pulls the bottom string with a gradually increasing force, does the top string or the bottom string break first? What if the bottom string is jerked, which string breaks?}	
	
\sol when tension gradually increases, system is always in equilibrium

tensions in strings must have $T_\text{top} = T_\text{bottom} + mg$

top string suffers a greater force, so it breaks first
	
however, when bottom string is jerked, the ball tends to remain at rest due to its large mass, preventing sudden change to the tension in top string

so in this case bottom string is more likely to snap \eoe

%\begin{example}{Leviation of a slinky}
%	When the top end of the slinky is dropped, the information of the tension change must propagate to the bottom end before both sides begin to fall; the top of an extended slinky will drop while the bottom initially remains in its original position, compressing the spring.
%\end{example}




\subsubsection{third law}

every force is part of a pair of interactions between one body and another

when one body exerts a force on another, the second body also exerts a reaction on the first

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{Newton's third law}, also called the \keypoint{action-reaction principle}, states that action and reaction are always equal in magnitude, opposite in directions and of the same type
\end{ilight}

\example{Suggest the action and reaction force in the following cases: (a) A man stands on a bathroom scale. (b) A helicopter hovers in air. (c) The earth orbits around the sun.}

\sol (a) man exerts downward force on scale, scale exerts an upward reaction on man

(b) rotors of helicopter push air downwards, air exerts an upward force on helicopter

(c) sun pulls the earth through gravitational attraction, earth also attracts the sun in return \eoe


\subsubsection{force analysis \& free-body diagrams}

when doing mechanics problems, it is necessary to find all forces applied upon an object

to visualise all these forces, it is helpful to draw a \keypoint{free-body diagram} (FBD)\index{free-body diagram}

an FBD shows a simplified version of the body with arrows indicating forces applied

\newpage

it is recommended to follow the routine stated below when solving a mechanics problem

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[(1)] draw a FBD for the object in the problem
	
	\item[(2)] resolve and find the resultant force with aid of the FBD
	
	\item[(3)] apply Newton's laws to write down the equation of motion for the object
	
	\item[(4)] solve the equation(s) to find acceleration
	
	\item[(5)] use kinematic relations to deduce information about motion of the object
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{types of forces}

\subsubsection{weight}\label{ch_weight}

all objects exert attractive forces of gravity upon each other\footnote{You will learn more about gravitational forces at A2 Level.}

\keypoint{weight} of a body is due to the gravitational pull from our planet -- the earth\index{weight}

weight $W$ of any object is proportional to its mass $m$: $\boxed{W=mg}$

$g$ is called the gravitational field strength, or the gravitational acceleration constant

\cmt at vicinity of earth's surface, gravitational field is almost uniform: $g \approx 9.81 \text{ N kg}^{-1}$

but this value for $g$ does not hold in a satellite orbit, on Mars, near a black hole, etc.

\cmt the concept of weight is different from mass in many aspects

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] weight is a force, so it is a vector (always acting downwards still makes a direction)
	
	mass is a scalar, it has magnitude only
	
	\item[--] weight is measured in newtons, mass is measured in kilograms
	
	\item[--] weight of object depends on its mass but also strength of gravitational field
	
	mass is an intrinsic property of object, so does not depend on force fields
	
	same object can have different weights on different planets, but its mass will be the same\footnote{Here we do not take into account the effects of \emph{relativity}. A clever student who has learned Einstein's theories might suggest the mass of the same object increases with its velocity.}
\end{compactitem}

\example{An astronaut finds that he weighs 300 N on the surface of Mars, where the gravitational field strength is known to be $3.7 \text{ N kg}^{-1}$. Find his mass and hence estimate his weight if he returns to his home on the Earth.}

\sol mass of astronaut: $m = \frac{W_M}{g_M} = \frac{300}{3.7} \approx 81.1 \text{ kg}$

weight on earth: $W_E = mg_E = 81.1 \times 9.81 \approx 795 \text{ N}$ \eoe

\subsubsection*{free fall}

all things on the earth fall because of the force of gravity

if we ignore the restraints such as air resistance and upthrust force on a falling object, say the object is under the influence of gravity only, then the object is in a state called \keypoint{free fall}



assuming the object is subject to gravity only, the resultant force is simply its weight

applying the Newton's second law, we have: $\fnet = W \RA ma = mg$

so acceleration of the freely-falling object is: $\boxed{a=g}$\footnote{In the derivation, the mass terms cancel out. Rigorously speaking, these are two different masses. One is the measure of inertia, and the other is a measure of gravitational force. It is experimentally found that the inertia mass and the gravitational mass are equal. The fact that the two masses are equal has profound reasons. We have shown here acceleration of free fall equals gravitational field strength, but Albert Einstein’s suggests that it is actually impossible to distinguish between a uniform acceleration and a uniform gravitational field. This idea lies at the heart of his \emph{general theory of relativity}. Those who are interested in this topic are recommended to start from here and do some online researches.}

\cmt this shows \keypoint{acceleration due to free fall} is simply equal to field strength $g$

so any object, regardless of its mass, has same acceleration due to free fall\footnote{In \S\ref{ch_freefall} and \S\ref{ch:projectile}, the statement that acceleration of free fall is constant in absence of air resistance was asserted without further explanation. Now you know why.}


\subsubsection{drag}

when a body moves through air, water or any fluid, it experiences resistance called drag force\index{drag}

\cmt factors that determine the value of fluid drag include

\titem relative speed of the object to the fluid ($v\up \ra f\up$)

\titem cross section of the object ($A\up \ra f\up$)

\titem shape of the object (streamlined shape has smaller drag)

\titem density of the fluid ($\rho\up \ra f\up$)

but what determines the drag force is a complicated issue\footnote{There are a few empirical formula for drag force, each of which is accurate under certain conditions.
	
	For an object moving through a fluid at low speeds (\emph{laminar flow}, no turbulence occurs), the resistance it experiences is proportional to its speed: $f=bv$, where $b$ is some constant which depends on fluid viscosity and the effective cross-sectional area of the object.
	
	If objects are moving at relative high speeds through the fluid such that \emph{turbulence} is produced behind the object, drag force is proportional to the speed squared: $ f = \frac{1}{2} \rho C_D A v^2$, where $\rho$ is the fluid's density, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, $C_D$ is a dimensionless quantity called the drag coefficient.}

\cmt drag force always acts in a direction to oppose relative motion of object through fluid




\subsubsection*{free fall through air}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.15\textwidth}
	\vspace*{-16pt}
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\draw[thick,blue,->] (0,0) -- (0,-2.5) node[right,black]{$mg$};
	\draw[thick,blue,->] (0,0) -- (0,1.5) node[right,black]{$f$};
	\draw[fill=gray!50] (0,0) circle (0.3);
	\draw[thick,purple,->] (1,0.5) -- (1,-0.5) node[right]{$v$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\vspace*{-16pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

let's consider an object falling through air from a very high tower

forces acting are weight and air resistance (shown in the free-body diagram)

equation of motion for this falling object is:

{
	\centering
	
	$ \fnet = mg - f = ma $
	
}

as $v$ increases, air resistance $f$ increases, so net force $\fnet$ decreases

this means acceleration $a$ would decrease as object falls

i.e., speed will increase at a decreasing rate during the fall
\footnote{The velocity-time relation can be obtained for some simple models. Suppose air resistance is proportional to speed of the falling body, i.e., $f=bv$, then the equation of motion reads: $\fnet = m \frac{\dd v}{\dd t} = mg - bv$, where acceleration is written explicitly as the rate of change in velocity. With the initial conditions $v=0$ at $t=0$, we can solve this differential equation to obtain the speed of this falling object at any given time $t$:
\begin{equation*}
	\dd t = \frac{\dd v}{g - \frac{b}{m}v} \RA \int_0^t \dd t = \int_0^v \frac{\dd v}{g - \frac{b}{m}v} \RA t = -\frac{m}{b} \ln \left(g - \frac{b}{m}v \right) \Bigg|_0^v = -\frac{m}{b} \ln \left( 1 - \frac{bv}{mg}\right)
\end{equation*}
	
Rearrange the terms, we find: $v(t) = \frac{mg}{b} \left(1 - \ee^{-\frac{bt}{m}} \right) $}

%$v$-$t$ graph for this process is shown on the next page


\begin{figure}[ht]

	\draw [thick,orange] (0,0) -- (1.8,3.6);
	\draw [thick,dashed] (0,2.5) node[left]{$v_t$} -- (7,2.5);
	\draw [->] (3,0.6) node[note]{When air drag is small at low speed,\\ acceleration $a$ is slightly less than $g$.} -- (0.45,0.6);
	\draw [->] (5,1.6) node[note]{Gravity is offset by the increasing air drag, \\ the velocity tends to a terminal value $v_t$.} -- (5,2.4);
	\draw [->] (4.2,3.1) node[note]{In absense of air, an object falls freely \\ with constant acceleration $g\approx9.81\mpss$.} -- (1.6,3.1);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption*{variation of velocity for a falling object through air}
\end{figure}

\cmt after sufficient long time, acceleration gradually decreases to zero

velocity gradually increases and tends to a maximum value

at this stage, equilibrium is restored: $f=mg$, object no longer accelerates

this constant final velocity is known as the \keypoint{terminal velocity}\index{terminal velocity}

\cmt at low speeds, air resistance is negligible, so $\fnet =ma \approx mg$

acceleration of object at start of the fall is similar to $g$

but as $v$ increases, acceleration decreases so $a$ becomes less than $g$




\example{An object of 5.0 kg falls through the atmosphere from a very high altitude. After some time, it falls at a constant speed of $70 \mps$. Assume there is no significant change in gravitational field during the fall and the air resistance is proportional to speed: $f=bv$. (a) Find the value of the coefficient $k$. (b) Find the acceleration of the object when it is falling at $30\mps$.}

\sol equilibrium between weight and air drag when falling at terminal speed, so
\begin{equation*}
	mg = bv_t \RA b = \frac{mg}{v_t} = \frac{5.0\times9.81}{70} \approx 0.70 \text{ kg s}^{-1}
\end{equation*}

at any instant, equation of motion is: $\fnet = ma = mg - bv$

at $30\mps$, acceleration is: $a = \frac{mg-bv}{m} = \frac{5.0\times9.81-0.70\times30}{5.0} \approx 5.6 \mpss$ \eoe

\subsubsection*{bubble rising in a liquid}

	\end{tikzpicture}
	\vspace*{-16pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

let's now consider bubbles formed at the bottom of a soda water

forces acting on bubble are weight, water resistance and upthrust

equation of motion for the rising bubble is:

{
	\centering
	
	$ \fnet = U - mg - f = ma $
	
}

as bubble moves faster, $f$ increases, then $\fnet$ decreases

so acceleration $a$ would gradually decrease to zero as bubble rises

speed of bubble increases and reaches a maximum value

at terminal speed, $a\to0$, one has: $U=f+mg$



\subsubsection{normal contact}

when two objects are in contact, the interaction between them is called the \emph{contact force}

\keypoint{normal contact force} is the component of contact force that is perpendicular to contact surface

\cmt by definition, normal contact is always at right angle to surface of contact

\cmt origin of normal contact is the \emph{electrostatic interaction} between atoms

when two objects are pressed against each other, surface atoms get close

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.3\textwidth}
	\vspace*{-10pt}
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
	\draw[thick] (-2,0) -- (2,0);

	\vspace*{-5pt}

electrostatic repulsion between electron clouds of the atoms prevent them from penetrating through one another


\example{A box of mass $m=4.0 \text{ kg}$ is resting on a horizontal ground. What is the normal contact force acting?}

\sol equilibrium between weight and normal contact, so

\example{A man of $80$ kg stands in a lift. Find his apparent weight, i.e., the contact force, when the lift is (a) moving upwards at steady speed of $2.0 \mps$, (b) accelerating upwards at $2.0 \mpss$, (c) moving upwards but slowing down at a deceleration of $1.5 \mpss$.}

\sol forces acting on man are weight and normal contact

for either case, equation of motion for the man reads:

{

\centering

$\fnet = ma = R - mg$

}

so normal contact force: $R = mg + ma$

when rising at steady speed, man is in equilibrium ($a=0$), so: $R=mg = 80\times9.81 \approx 785 \text{ N}$

when accelerating upwards ($a = +2.0 \mpss$): $R = 80 \times 9.81 + 80 \times 2.0 \approx 945 \text{ N}$

when decelerating upwards ($a = -1.5 \mpss$): $R = 80 \times 9.81 + 80 \times (-1.5) \approx 665 \text{ N}$ \eoe

\sol free-body diagrams for both cases are shown

for both cases, no net force acts in vertical direction

\subsubsection{friction}

friction is the component of contact force that is parallel to contact surfaces

when there is potential or actual sliding between surfaces, frictional force come into action\index{friction}

\titem for surfaces \emph{tend} to move relative to each other, \keypoint{static friction} acts to oppose this tendency

\titem if surfaces are already sliding over one another, then \keypoint{kinetic friction} opposes this motion

\cmt static friction $f_S$ is self-adjusting

an object placed on a rough surface can stay at rest when acted by a small external force $F$

it can do so because $f_S$ equalises external force to maintain equilibrium

if no external force acts, then $f_S=0$

\cmt there exists a maximum limiting friction $f_\text{lim}$

when external force $F < f_\text{lim}$, there is sufficient $f_S$ to prevent object from sliding

when $F = f_\text{lim}$, object is on the verge of sliding

when $F>f_\text{lim}$, object start to move and static friction becomes kinetic friction $f_K$

\cmt factors that determine frictional forces are

\titem nature of contacting surfaces (for both $f_S$ and $f_K$)

\titem normal reaction $R$ (for $f_K$)

these dependences are usually expressed by a mathematical equation $\boxed{f_K \approx f_\text{lim} = \mu R}$

$\mu$ is the \emph{coefficient of friction} whose value depends on the nature of the two surfaces\footnote{The idea of limiting friction is not required in the AS Physics syllabus, but it is required in \emph{Mechanics 1} of the A-Level Mathematics course.}

\cmt friction, on microscopic level, is an \emph{electromagnetic force} in nature

when two surfaces are in contact, irregularities on the surface touch each other

surface atoms come very close and bonds are formed through electrostatic force

in some sense, surface atoms get \emph{cold welded} to each other

when surfaces try to move relative to each other, this electrostatic weld is origin of friction

the problem is about a mass $m$ placed on a plane inclined at angle $\theta$ to the horizontal

the mass could sit at rest on, slide down, or get pulled/pushed up the plane

motion of the mass could be affected by weight, friction, normal contact, or other forces

\cmt forces can be resolved in directions parallel and perpendicular to the slope

resolving along the slope leads to the equation of motion from which acceleration is found

\cmt it is almost inevitable to break weight into two components\footnote{We have already done that in Example \ref{ex:comp-of-W}.}

\titem component of weight parallel down the slope is: $W_\parallelslant = mg\sin\theta$

\titem component of weight perpendicular to slope is: $W_\perp = mg\cos\theta$

note that component of weight down the slope is: $W_\parallelslant = mg\sin\theta = 3.0\times9.81\times18^\circ \approx 9.1 \text{ N}$

\subsection{many-body problems}

the problems we have been dealing with so far only involve one body

a mechanical system could consist of several objects that mutually interact

\cmt one can take each individual and look into the \textit{internal} forces between the objects of interest

for any force acting between objects \emph{within} system, there is an equal but opposite reaction force

\cmt the system can also be treated as a whole

we can analyse \textit{net external force} acting on entire system and work out combined acceleration

\vspace{0.4em} adding the two equations, we have:

{
	\centering
	
	$ mg = (M+m) a $
	
}

so acceleration is:

{
	\centering
	
	$a = \frac{mg}{M+m} = \frac{2.0\times9.81}{4.0+2.0} = 3.27 \mpss$
	
}

tension in string: $T = Ma = 4.0 \times 3.27 \approx 13.1 \text{ N}$ \eoe
