\section{Waves}

Wave is a way of transferring and storing \emph{energy} without the transport of matter. Most familiar examples are surface waves on water, sound waves, light waves. In the next two chapters, we are going to look at the basics of wave motion and some of the most important wave phenomena.

%Wave motion is the propagation of disturbance -- deviations from a state of equilibrium -- from one place to another. 
%
%Waves consist of continuous oscillations around some fixed locations.
%
%There are mainly two types of waves, \keypoint{mechanical waves} and \keypoint{electromagnetic waves}. Mechanical waves propagate as oscillations of matter, thus it must travel through a \emph{medium}. Electromagnetic waves can travel in free space.
%
%A wave can either be \keypoint{transverse} or \keypoint{longitudinal} depending on the direction of its oscillation. The direction of propagation of a transverse wave is perpendicular to the direction of its oscillation, and the wave motion of a longitudinal wave is parallel to its oscillation.

\subsection{wave terminologies}

wave motion is the propagation of disturbance from one place to another

	\caption*{wave pattern at different times ($t_1<t_2<t_3<t_4$) as wave travels in space}
\end{figure}


to describe the wave motion and particle vibrations, we can define the following quantities:


\cmt as a wave moves out, each point oscillates back and forth about their rest positions

distance from a particle's equilibrium position is called \keypoint{displacement} of the particle 

\cmt greatest displacement for a particle is called the \keypoint{amplitude} ($A$) \index{amplitude}

\cmt wave pattern repeats itself over a certain distance

distance between two adjacent points undergoing exactly same motion is the \keypoint{wavelength} ($\lambda$) \index{wavelength}

one can think of wavelength as crest-to-crest distance, trough-to-trough distance, etc.\footnote{For now, we take for granted that a wave is transverse. There are also longitudinal waves for which terms like crest and trough do not apply. We will get into that in \S\ref{ch-Lwaves}.}

\cmt each point also repeats its vibrational motion over a certain time interval

time for a particle to complete a full oscillation cycle is the  \keypoint{period} ($T$) \index{period}

\cmt number of oscillations for a particle per unit time is the \keypoint{frequency} ($f$) \index{frequency}

frequency can also be defined as the number of crests passing a given point per unit time

frequency of a wave is related to its period by $\boxed{f=\frac{1}{T}}$

unit of frequency: $[f] = \text{Hz}$ (hertz), where $1 \text{ Hz} = 1 \text{ s}^{-1}$

\end{figure}

\cmt wave energy is transferred along the direction of wave motion at a certain speed $v$

in one period, wave moves forward by a distance of one wavelength

so \keypoint{wave speed} $\boxed{v=\frac{\lambda}{T}}$, or in terms of frequency, $\boxed{v=\lambda f}$

\example{When a wave travels on a water surface, the maximum depth of water is 21 cm and the minimum depth is 18 cm. What is the amplitude of the wave?}

\sol amplitude is half the end-to-end distance: $ A = \frac{1}{2}(21-18) = 1.5 \text{ cm} $ \eoe


\example{A wave travelling at $4.0 \mps$ has a wavelength of 50 cm, what is its period?}

\solc\begin{equation*}
	v = \frac{\lambda}{T} \RA T = \frac{\lambda}{v} = \frac{0.50}{4.0} = 0.125 \text{ s} \teoe
\end{equation*}








\subsection{transverse \& longitudinal waves}

a wave can either be \emph{transverse} or \emph{longitudinal}, depending on the direction of its oscillation

\subsubsection{transverse waves}

\begin{ilight}
	a \keypoint{transverse} wave has vibrations at right angle to its direction of energy transfer \index{transverse wave}
\end{ilight}

\cmt examples of transverse waves: wave on a string, surface wave on water, light wave, etc.

\cmt for a transverse wave, greatest displacement in positive direction is called a \emph{crest}, or a \emph{peak}

greatest displacement in negative direction is called a \emph{trough}


\subsubsection{longitudinal waves} \label{ch-Lwaves}

\begin{ilight}
	a \keypoint{longitudinal} wave has vibrations in parallel direction to energy transfer \index{longitudinal wave}
\end{ilight}

\cmt examples of longitudinal waves: sound waves, wave along a stretched slinky, etc.

\cmt for a longitudinal wave, if medium gets squeezed, we say this region is a \emph{compression}

if a medium expands, we say this region is a \emph{rarefaction}

\cmt wavelength of a longitudinal wave can be defined as compression-to-compression distance

\example{What is the distance between a compression and a rarefaction for a sound wave of frequency 550 Hz? (Speed of sound in air is about $330 \mps$.)}

\solc\begin{equation*}
	d = \frac{1}{2}\lambda = \frac{v}{2f} = \frac{330}{2\times 550} \RA d = 0.30 \text{ m} \teoe
\end{equation*}


\subsubsection{sound waves}

sound waves propagate via the compression and rarefaction of air (or other medium) \index{sound}

molecules near vibrating source is pushed away from rest positions and into their neighbours

neighbouring molecules then in turn push into their neighbours, and so on

the disturbance is transferred through the medium, forming a sound wave

\cmt sound waves are longitudinal
	
\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{longitudinal.pdf}
	\caption*{disturbance of vibrating molecules in a sound wave}
\end{figure}

\cmt propagation of sound waves require medium (air, water, steel, etc.)
	
sound cannot travel in vacuum
	
\cmt speed of sound is material-dependent, but not frequency-dependent
	
	sound in general travels faster in denser medium
	
	\titem $v_\text{air} \approx 340 \mps$ (under standard atmospheric pressure and room temperature)
	
	\titem $v_\text{water} \approx 1500 \mps$
	
	\titem $v_\text{steel} \approx 5000 \mps$
	
\cmt \emph{pitch} of a note is related to frequency of sound wave

rapid vibrations of sound source at high frequencies produce a high pitch

\cmt \emph{loudness} of sound mainly depends on amplitude of vibration

a greater amplitude means the wave is more energetic so it sounds louder
	

\subsubsection*{measurement of sound waves}

two key apparatuses for sound measurement are the \keypoint{microphone} and the \keypoint{oscilloscope} \index{oscilloscope}

oscilloscope can be thought as an upgraded voltmeter showing how voltage varies with time

sound waves can be captured by a \emph{microphone}, which converts sound into electrical signals

electrical signals can then be sent into an \emph{oscilloscope} (see figure\footnote{The beautiful figure of the oscilloscope was created by \emph{Hugues Vermeiren}, who generously shared the source codes on TeXample: \url{http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/textronics-oscilloscope/}}) for measurement

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics*[width=0.9\textwidth]{oscilloscope.pdf}
	
	the display and controls of a typical cathode-ray oscilloscope
\end{figure}

\cmt oscilloscope displays the variation of voltage ($y$-axis) with time ($x$-axis)

\cmt horizontal scale (time axis) is given by \emph{time-base} settings

vertical scale (voltage axis) is given by \emph{voltage gain}, or \emph{Y-sensitivity} settings

\cmt period $T$ of the sound wave can be found using time-base settings

then frequency of sound wave is calculated: $f=\frac{1}{T}$

\cmt voltage amplitude can be found using the voltage gain

	\draw[Green!20, ultra thick, domain=0:7, samples=100] plot (\x, {2*sin((\x-0.6)*120)});
	\draw[black!80, step=1] (0,-3) grid (7,3);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\vspace*{-16pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

\example{A sound wave is detected by a microphone and the trace is displayed on an oscilloscope as shown. If the time-base is set at 0.5 ms div$^{-1}$ and the voltage gain is set at 2 V div$^{-1}$. What is the frequency and the amplitude of the signal?}

\sol period: $T = 3 \times 0.5 \text{ ms} = 1.5 \times10^{-3} \text{ s}$

\eqyskip frequency: $f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{1.5 \times10^{-3} \text{ s}} \approx 667 \text{ Hz}$

\eqyskip amplitude: $A = 2 \times 2 \text{ V} = 4.0 \text{ V}$ \eoe




\subsection{electromagnetic waves}

a wave can be either \emph{mechanical} or \emph{electromagnetic}, depending on whether it requires a medium\index{electromagnetic wave}

\cmt waves that require a \emph{medium} to travel are called \keypoint{mechanical waves}

examples are sound waves, water waves, wave on a string, etc.

mechanical waves involve vibration of matter particles

\cmt no medium is needed for propagation of \keypoint{electromagnetic waves} i.e., they can travel in vacuum



\subsubsection{properties of electromagnetic waves}

\cmt electromagnetic waves can travel in free space

\cmt electromagnetic waves involve vibrations of electric and magnetic fields
	
an altering electric field can generate an altering magnetic field, which then further produces a new altering electric field, so on and so forth

electric and magnetic fields then permeate through space, transferring energy and information
	
\cmt electromagnetic waves are all transverse
	
vibration of electric fields and magnetic fields are both perpendicular to wave motion

\cmt all electromagnetic waves travel at a constant speed $c=3.0\times10^8\mps$ in free space

i.e., speed of light in vacuum is constant\footnote{The speed of light in vacuum is actually a \emph{universal} physical constant. According to Einstein's special relativity, this is the upper limit for the speed at which matter and information can travel. This speed is also independent of the inertial reference frame one chooses, i.e., the speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer.}

electromagnetic waves come in a wide range of wavelengths and frequencies

\cmt the table below shows electromagnetic spectrum in somewhat more precise details \footnote{There are no precise accepted boundaries between different ranges in the electromagnetic spectrum. The boundaries are actually somewhat ambiguous. The ranges of different portions tend to overlap. For example, a large portion of the ranges of X-rays overlap with that of $\gamma$-rays, and microwaves are considered by many people as a subdivision of radio waves. Therefore, the values given here are merely supposed to give you some rough idea about the order of magnitudes for electromagnetic wavelengths and frequencies. So the point I want to make here is: do not take the borderlines too seriously.}

\cmt each type of electromagnetic waves has important applications in some area
\footnote{The entries listed here only include a teeny-weeny part of the uses of electromagnetic radiation, somewhat based on my personal taste. I also included a handful of explanations for the examples that I found interesting (otherwise I would not choose them), as you will see a huge load of footnotes in the next few pages. You are encouraged to do some researches as well, I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed.}

	\xskip telecommunication (TV/radio broadcast, satellite communication) \footnote{Having the longest wavelengths of all radiation, radio waves have the best ability to diffract around obstacles in city buildings and mountains, therefore a large area can be covered.}

	\item[--] microwaves
	
	\xskip telecommunication (mobile phones, WiFi, Bluetooth, satellite communication)
	\footnote{Microwaves do not diffract sufficiently as radio waves, but they can transmit more information per unit time because they have higher frequencies. Microwaves are used in short-range telecommunication, including mobile phones, wireless networks, and bluetooth connections.}
		
		
	\xskip heating food (microwave ovens)
	\footnote{Frequency of microwaves are close to the natural frequencies of the rotational motion of water molecules. When food is exposed to microwaves, the water molecules in the food resonate and vibrate more violently, causing a rise in the temperature.}
	
	\item[--] infrared (IR)
	
	\xskip IR thermography (temperature monitors, thermographic cameras)
	\footnote{All objects emit electromagnetic radiation based on their temperatures. According to the law of black-body radiation, objects near room temperature emit thermal energy as infrared radiation, so variations in the temperature can be detected.}
	
	\xskip night-vision devices
	\footnote{Night-vision devices convert photons (just think of them as particles of light for now) into electrons, which are amplified by a chemical and electrical process and then converted back into visible light. Infrared sources can be used to augment the available light, increasing the visibility in the dark.}
	
	\xskip IR heating (IR heat lamps, IR saunas)
	
	
	\xskip IR data transmission (remote controls, optical-fibre communication)
	
	\item[--] visible light
	
	\xskip human vision
	\footnote{Human eyes are only sensitive to a small fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum. The wide variety of colours that we see is actually built up from the relative intensities of red, green and blue light collected by the three colour detectors in our eyes.}
	
	\item[--] ultraviolet (UV)
	
	\xskip UV sterilising (drinking water treatment, disinfection in medical facilities, etc.)
	\footnote{Short-wavelength UV light can damage the DNA's in living organisms. A microorganism exposed to germicidal UV light might not be able to reproduce, and becomes harmless. For the same reason, overexposure to UV radiation present in the sunlight can cause sunburn, or even skin cancer.}
		
	\xskip fluorescent dyes (black light fluorescent paint, UV watermarks)
	\footnote{UV radiation can cause many substances to glow through chemical reactions. UV watermarks that are visible under UV light are used to prevent counterfeiting of currency, or forgery of important documents such as passports and ID cards.}
	
	\item[--] X-rays
	
	\xskip medical imaging (X-ray imaging, CT scans)
	\footnote{X-rays are very energetic and thus very penetrating. They can pass through human body easily to form an image giving information about the structures of tissues and bones.}
	
	\xskip security check (luggage scanners)
	
	\xskip X-ray crystallography
	\footnote{X-rays can be diffracted by the lattice of atoms in a crystal. The diffraction pattern gives information about the structure of the lattice. X-ray crystallography is a very important experimental technique to study the microscopic structures of new materials.}
	
	\item[--] $\gamma$-rays
	
	\xskip radiation therapies (cancer treatment)
	\footnote{$\gamma$-rays have extremely high frequencies. They are even more energetic and penetrating. They can be used to damage the DNA of cancerous tissue, and hence kill the cancerous cells as a treatment.}
	
	\xskip medical imaging (PET scans)
	\footnote{Positron emission tomography (PET) uses a radioactive tracer to produce $\gamma$-rays within the tissues of interest. The energy and location of these $\gamma$-rays can be detected and sent to a computer to build up a 3D image of the body part.}

\subsection{wave intensity}

energy can be transmitted along a wave

the degree to which energy is concentrated is called the intensity of the wave

here concentration has two meanings -- concentration in time and concentration in area $S$\footnote{To avoid confusion, I reserved letter `$A$' for wave amplitude and chose `$S$' to represent an area.}

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{intensity} of a wave is defined as the power $P$ per unit area on a cross section $S$: $\boxed{I=\frac{P}{S}}$ \index{wave intensity}
\end{ilight}

\cmt unit of wave intensity: $[I] = \text{ W m}^{-2}$

\cmt intensity is proportional to square of its amplitude: $\boxed{I \propto A^2}$.

\cmt intensity of a wave decreases as it spreads out in space

intensity at distance of $r$ from a point source is inversely proportional to $r^2$: $\boxed{I \propto \frac{1}{r^2}}$
\footnote{As a wave produced from a point source travels out by a distance $r$ away from the source, the energy it carries is spread uniformly over the surface area of the sphere of radius $r$, that is: $S=4\pi r^2$. So the intensity of a wave obeys an inverse square law: $I \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$.}

\example{If the amplitude of an incoming wave is increased by 50\%, what is the increase in the wave intensity?}

\sol $I \propto A^2 \RA \frac{I'}{I} = \left( \frac{A'}{A} \right)^2 = \left( 1 + 50\% \right)^2 =2.25 \RA \qquad$ so intensity is increased by 125\% \eoe

\subsection{polarisation}

\subsubsection{plane polarisation}

\begin{ilight}
	a wave is \keypoint{plane-polarised}, or simply \keypoint{polarised}, if the vibration is in one single direction at right angle to the direction of propagation of energy\index{polarisation}
\end{ilight}

\cmt polarisation\footnote{Apart from plane polarisation where the vibrations are fixed in a single direction, there are also \emph{circular} or \emph{elliptical} polarisation, for which the direction of vibrations \emph{rotate} in a plane as the wave travels.} is a phenomenon associated with \emph{transverse} waves only

longitudinal waves (such as sound waves) cannot be polarised

this is because longitudinal vibrations are always parallel to direction of energy transfer

\cmt most important examples are polarisation of \emph{electromagnetic waves}

regarding vibration of electromagnetic waves, we usually focus on variations of electric field

\cmt sunlight, light emitted from incandescent bulbs are unpolarised

they are emitted randomly from their sources, so they contain all planes of polarisation


\cmt a few of the great many applications of polarisation are:

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] polarising sunglasses \& photography \footnote{When unpolarised light is reflected at the boundary of two media, the reflected beam would become partially polarised. Polarising sunglasses use this effect to reduce the sunlight reflected from shiny surfaces, such as a lake (for sightseeing tourists) or road surfaces (for drivers). For the same reason, photographers often place a polarising filter in front of the camera lens to darken skies and increase the contrast.}
	
	\item[--] polarised 3D films\footnote{The eyeglasses worn by viewers contain a pair of polarising filters with mutually perpendicular axes. When two images are projected onto the same screen, each filter restricts the light reaching each eye by passing only one of the images that is polarised in the same direction. This creates an 3D illusion.}
	
	\item[--] liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology\footnote{Liquid crystal arrays can be realigned by applying an electric field. This causes the axis of polarization to rotate, hence backlight may be allowed to pass or be blocked, forming dark patterns of the display.}
	
	\item[--] radio transmission and reception\footnote{Since electric currents flow in certain directions only, so the radio waves and microwaves produced from aerials are intrinsically polarised. This means the reception of signals would be sensitive to a particular direction, but totally insensitive to the normal direction. This explains why altering the orientation of antennas could greatly enhance the quality of reception.}
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{polarisers \& Malus's law}

a plane-polarised light can be produced from unpolarised light using a \keypoint{polariser}

a polariser blocks vibrations in all planes except the plane of polarisation\footnote{What we are discussing here is just one type of polariser, often called a \emph{linear absorptive polariser}, which is basically a synthetic transparent plastic sheet made of certain crystals. The thin sheet contains long-chain organic molecules aligned parallel to each other. When an unpolarised light passes through the polariser, there is a strong absorption of the electric field parallel to the alignment of molecules, so vibration of the electric field is allowed to pass in one direction only.}

direction along which vibration is allowed to pass is called the axis of the polariser

\cmt if polarised light of initial intensity $I_0$ has an angle $\theta$ to the axis of analyser

\keypoint{Malus's law}\index{Malus's law} states that transmitted intensity is given by: $\boxed{I = I_0 \cos^2 \theta}$

this is because only electric field parallel to axis of analyser is transmitted

so transmitted amplitude\footnote{This is actually the amplitude of the electric field strength.} satisfies: $A = A_0 \cos\theta$, where $A_0$ is the initial amplitude

recall that intensity is proportional to square of amplitude, so $I = I_0 \cos^2 \theta $

\subsection{diffraction}

a wave has the ability to bend around obstacles or pass through narrow gaps

\begin{ilight}
	when a wave passes through a aperture/slit/gap/hole or encounters an obstacle, it spreads out/around the corners, this is is known as \keypoint{diffraction}\index{diffraction} of waves
\end{ilight}

\cmt diffraction is a general property of all waves

some examples of diffraction are

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] sound waves can diffract through an open door
	
	so you can hear people in the next room talking, even though you cannot see them
	
	\item[--] light ray can bend when it goes through/around a small hole/small particles
	
	sky appears red at sunset as red light is diffracted most by dust particles in atmosphere
\end{compactitem}

\cmt a wave is diffracted most when its wavelength is close to size of aperture/obstacle

a wave with longer wavelength usually diffracts more than a wave of shorter wavelength

\subsection{Doppler effect}

\begin{ilight}
	relative motion between wave source and the observer causes a change in observed frequency, this is known as the \keypoint{Doppler effect}\index{Doppler effect}
\end{ilight}

\cmt any type of wave can exhibit Doppler effect

\cmt when wave source moves towards observer, a higher frequency is observed

when wave source moves away from observer, a lower frequency is observed

\cmt Doppler effect also occurs if source is at rest but observer is in motion

as long as there is \emph{radial} motion between source and observer, there is shift in frequency

\cmt Doppler effect finds its use in many areas, some examples are

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] \emph{Doppler radars}: used to measure velocity of moving target (speeding cars, tennis balls, etc.)
	
	\item[--] \emph{Doppler ultrasonography}: used to image blood flow in human bodies
	
	\item[--] \emph{astronomy}: used to study motion of stars and galaxies
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection*{explanation for Doppler effect}

suppose wave source is moving towards the observer at speed $v_s$

at time $t=0$, the source emits a wavefront which travels at speed $v$

after one period, wavefront travels forward by a distance of $vT$

at same time, source moves forward by a distance of $v_s T$ and emits a new wavefront

if source is at rest, observer simply perceives a wavelength $\lambda = vT$

now source is moving closer, a shorter wavelength $\lambda'$ is perceived

since frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, so higher frequency $f'$ is observed

similar discussion follow for the case where source moves away from observer

\cmt change in observed frequency is due to change in wavelength caused by relative motion

if source moves towards/away from observer, apparent wavelength becomes shorter/longer

\subsubsection*{Doppler effect equation}

we are now ready to derive an equation for the shift of observed frequency

quantitatively, we can write: $\lambda' = \lambda \mp v_s T \quad$ ("$-$"/"$+$" if source is moving closer/away)

using $v = \lambda f$ and $f=\frac{1}{T}$, this becomes: $ \frac{v}{f'} = \frac{v}{f} \mp \frac{v_s}{f} $

rearranging, one finds observed frequency is given by: $\boxed{f' = f\frac{v}{v \mp v_s}}$

\example{A police car moving towards you at $16 \mps$ sirens at 500 Hz. Given that the speed of sound in air is $340\mps$, at what frequency do you hear the siren?}

\solc\begin{equation*}
	f' = f\frac{v}{v - v_s} = 500 \times \frac{340}{340-16} \RA f' \approx 525 \text{ Hz} \teoe
\end{equation*}

\example{A star emits an $H_\alpha$ line of wavelength 656 nm. (a) What is the frequency of this $H_\alpha$ line? (b) An observer on earth detects a wavelength of 680 nm, what can we say about motion of the star? (c) Find the relative speed of the star with respect to the earth.}

\sol original frequency of $H_\alpha$: $f = \frac{c}{\lambda} = \frac{3.00\times10^8}{656 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.57 \times 10^{14} \text{ Hz}$

observed wavelength is longer (redshift), this means the star is moving away, or receding

to find speed of star, we can consider observed frequency: $f' = \frac{c}{\lambda'} = f\frac{c}{c + v_s}$
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{3.00\times10^8}{680\times10^{-9}} = 4.57 \times 10^{14} \times \frac{3.00\times10^8}{3.00\times10^8 + v_s} \RA v_s \approx 1.10 \times 10^7 \mps
\end{equation*}
	
alternatively, we can consider observed wavelength: $\lambda' = \lambda + v_s T$, or: $\Delta \lambda = \lambda' - \lambda = \frac{v_s}{f}$
\begin{equation*}
	(680-656)\times10^{-9} = \frac{v_s}{4.57 \times 10^{14}} v_s \approx 1.10 \times 10^7 \mps \teoe
\end{equation*}
