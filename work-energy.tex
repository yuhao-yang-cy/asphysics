\section{Work \& Energy}

We have considered in the previous chapter the accumulative effect of a force over a period of time and have seen how this gives rise to the idea of impulse and momentum. In this chapter, we consider the effect of a force over a certain displacement, and you will learn how this is related to the concept of work done and energy.

Energy is a concept central to all of physical sciences. The entire universe is made up by energy and matter. In this section we study the energy changes during various physical processes.

\subsection{work}

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{work done} by a force is defined as the product of the force and the displacement moved out in the direction of the force: $\boxed{W=Fs}$ \index{work}
\end{ilight}

\cmt unit for work done: $[W]=[F][s]=\text{N}\cdot\text{m}\equiv \text{J (joule)}$

if a one newton force makes an object move out by one metre, then it does work of one \keypoint{joule}

\cmt if force acts at angle $\theta$ to the displacement travelled, then: $\boxed{W=Fs\cos\theta} $

\cmt work is a \emph{scalar} quantity\footnote{Although work is defined as the product of two vectors, work carries no information about direction. This vector product is called as a \emph{scalar product} or a \emph{dot product}, which can be written explicitly as: $W = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{s} = |F||s|\cos\theta$. You might have seen this operation in the A-Level course in Mathematics.}, i.e., it has no direction


\cmt work done can be either positive or negative

resistive forces, such as friction and air drag, act in the opposite direction to motion

so work done by resistive forces is negative\footnote{You might take $\theta=180^\circ$, then $\cos\theta = -1$, giving rise to a negative work done.}, we say this is work \emph{against} resistance

the minus sign will be crucial in energy calculations in later discussions

\cmt a gas can do work to/against the surroundings

if pressure stays constant, then work by/on gas: $W = F \Delta s = p A \Delta s \RA \boxed{W_\text{gas} = p\Delta V}$

\cmt work done by a varying force\footnote{The equation $W=Fs$ is valid only if the force acting is constant.
	
Similarly, the equation $W_\text{gas} = p\Delta V$ holds for constant pressure processes only.} is found by integration or using a $F$-$s$ graph



if force varies with position, its change over small displacements is still considered small

work done over an infinitesimal displacement is therefore $\dd W = F\dd s$

integrate from initial position to final position, total work done is given by: $ \boxed{W=\int_i^f F \dd s} $

if one plots force against displacement, then $\boxed{\text{area under $F$-$s$ curve gives work done}}$

\example{A 20 N force is applied at 60$^\circ$ to the horizontal to move a 1.0 kg object at a constant speed of 2.0$\mps$ for 30 s. How much work is done by the force?}

\solc \begin{equation*}
W = Fs\cos\theta = Fvt\cos\theta = 20 \times 2.0 \times 30 \times \cos60^\circ \RA W = 600\text{ J} \teoe
\end{equation*}

\example{A piston in a gas pump has an area of 600 cm$^2$. During one stroke, the pump moves a distance of 30 cm against a constant pressure of 8000 Pa. How much work is done?}

\solc \begin{equation*}
W = p \Delta V = p A \Delta s = 8000 \times 600 \times 10^{-4} \times 30 \times 10^{-2} \RA W = 144 \text{ J} \teoe

\subsection{types of energies}\label{ch-KE}

Energy is something acquired by an object that enables it to do work. A moving vehicle, water stored in a reservoir, a compressed spring, separated magnets, all of these objects can do work to other objects. In this section, we will look at various situations where work on an object causes a change in some form of energy.


\subsubsection{kinetic energy}

suppose a constant force $F$ is acting over a distance $s$, we have:
\begin{equation*}
	W=Fs \xlongequal{F=ma} mas \xlongequal{v^2 = u^2 + 2as} m \frac{v^2-u^2}{2} \RA W = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{1}{2}mu^2
\end{equation*}

this shows work is transformed into change in some quantity associated with object's motion

this is recognised as the gain in kinetic energy of the object: $ \Delta E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{1}{2}mu^2 $

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{kinetic energy} (K.E.) is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion  \index{energy!kinetic}
\end{ilight}

\cmt an object of mass $m$ moving with speed $v$ has K.E.: $ \boxed{E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2} $

\example{Estimate the kinetic energy of a running man.}

\sol suppose the man has a mass of 75 kg and is running at $5 \mps$ (any reasonable value will do)
\begin{equation*}
	E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}\times75\times5^2 \approx 940 \text{ J} \teoe
\end{equation*}



\subsubsection{gravitational potential energy}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.3\textwidth}
	\vspace*{-12pt}
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw[thick,dashed] (0,1.5) --++ (2,0) node[right]{$h_1$}; 
		\draw[thick,dashed] (0,4) --++ (2,0) node[right]{$h_2$};
		\draw[fill] (1,4.1) circle (0.1);
		\draw[gray] (1,1.6) circle (0.1);
		\draw[thick,blue,->] (1,1.8) -- (1,3.9) node[midway,right]{$W=mg\Delta h$};
		\draw[thick] (0,0.5) --++ (2,0) node[right]{ground};
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\vspace*{-16pt}
\end{wrapfigure}


consider a body being slowly pulled from a height of $h_1$ to $h_2$

work done for this process is: $W = Fs = mg\Delta h = mgh_2 - mgh_1$

this shows work is transformed into change in some quantity associated with object's position

we say this is the gain in gravitational potential energy:

{
	\centering
	
	$\Delta E_p = mgh_2 - mgh_1$
	
}

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{gravitational potential energy} (G.P.E.) is the energy possessed by a body due to its position in a gravitational field\index{energy!gravitational potential}
\end{ilight}

\cmt a body of mass $m$ at a height of $h$ has G.P.E.: $\boxed{E_p = mgh}$

\cmt G.P.E. is a \emph{relative} quantity, only its change is important in physical processes
\footnote{The formula $E_p = mgh$ implies that we have defined G.P.E. at the ground level to be zero. But this is purely conventional. Here I would like to point out that one can freely choose any zero potential energy level as he/she wishes, but no matter what point is picked as reference, we will always agree on the quantity of physical significance, that is, the \emph{change} in G.P.E between two fixed points.}






\subsubsection{elastic potential energy}

let's now consider a spring being stretched or compressed

work is done by external forces to cause the change in shape

this becomes of the elastic energy stored in the body

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{elastic potential energy}, also called \keypoint{strain energy}, is the energy possessed by an elastic body due to deformation \index{energy!elastic potential}
\end{ilight}

this topic will be revisited in details in \S\ref{ch-springs}

\subsubsection{other types of energies}

apart from those we have mentioned above, there are many other types of energies 

\titem \emph{electric potential energy}: energy of a charged object due to its position in an electric field

\titem \emph{chemical energy}: ability to do work due to potential energy between atoms and molecules

\titem \emph{nuclear energy}: ability to do work due to potential energy of subatomic particles in the nuclei

\titem \emph{internal energy}: sum of random kinetic and potential energies of molecules in a substance

\titem \emph{electromagnetic energy}: energy carried by light/electromagnetic waves


\subsubsection{work \& energy transformations}

from previous discussions, we have seen doing work is a way of transferring energy

for examination purposes\footnote{More rigorous discussions (which go beyond the syllabus) are given in \S\ref{ch:conservation-of-energy}.}, we can say the following:

\begin{ilight}
	the change in the total energy of an object equals the net work done by all external forces (excluding those associated with potential energies): $\boxed{W  = \Delta E} $
\end{ilight}

\example{A racing car of 800 kg starts off from rest. If the driving force is 5000 N, and the car experiences a constant resistive force of 1500 N, what is its speed after it has travelled 50 m?}

\sol gain in K.E. equals work by driving force plus \emph{negative} work against resistance
\begin{equation*}
W_\text{total} = \Delta E_k \RA Fs - fs = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - 0 \RA (5000 - 1500)\times50 = \frac{1}{2}\times800\times v^2 \RA v\approx20.9\mps \teoe
\end{equation*}

\example{A concrete cube of side 0.50 m and density 2400 kg m$^{-3}$ is lifted 4.0 m by a crane. How much work is done?}

\sol work by crane equals gain in G.P.E. of cube
\begin{equation*}
W = \Delta E_p \RA W = mg\Delta h = \rho V g \Delta h = 2400 \times 0.50^3 \times 9.81 \times 4.0 \approx 1.18\times10^4 \text{ J} \teoe
\end{equation*}


\subsection{conservation of energy}\label{ch:conservation-of-energy}

\subsubsection{work-energy theorem ($\star$)}

more generally, net work done due to several forces $F_1$, $F_2$, $\dots$, acting on an object is
\begin{equation*}
W_\text{total} = \sum W_i = \sum \left(\int_i^f F_i \dd s\right) = \int_i^f \left(\sum F_i \right)\dd s = \int_i^f F_\text{net} \dd s = \int_i^f ma \dd s
\end{equation*}

recall in kinematics, $a=\frac{\dd v}{\dd t}$ and $\dd s = v \dd t$, so we have
\begin{equation*}
W_\text{total} = \int_i^f m \frac{\dd v}{\dd t} v \dd t = \int_i^f m v \dd v
\end{equation*}

we are integrating over velocity from initial value $u$ to final value $v$, wo we find
\begin{equation*}
W_\text{total} = \int_i^f m v \dd v = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \Big|_u^v = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{1}{2}mu^2
\end{equation*}

identify kinetic energy $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, now we come to the \keypoint{work-energy theorem}  \index{work-energy theorem}

\begin{ilight}
	the net work done on a body equals the change in the body's kinetic energy: $\boxed{W_\text{total} = \Delta E_k}$
\end{ilight}



\subsubsection{conservative forces \& potential energy ($\star$)}


if work by a force does not depend on which specific path is taken, this force is \keypoint{conservative}

put differently, when an object is moved from one place to another under a conservative force, work done depends on initial and final positions only

we can split $W_\text{total}$ into two parts: contributions from conservative and non-conservative forces

for conservative part, let's define: $\Delta E_p = - W_{c} = - \int_i^f F_c \dd s $

this means work by conservative forces can be interpreted as change in its \keypoint{potential energy}

let's call the sum of kinetic and potential energy of a body its \keypoint{mechanical energy}: $E_m = E_k + E_p$

work-energy theorem can then be rewritten as: $W_\text{nc} = \Delta E_k + \Delta E_p = \Delta E_m$

\begin{ilight}
	the change in mechanical energy equals the net work done by all non-conservative forces
\end{ilight}


\newpage

\subsubsection*{gravitational potential energy revisited ($\star$)}

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.32\textwidth}
	\vspace{-54pt}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[xscale=1.4]
		\draw[thick,->,blue] (0,0) node[below]{\textcolor{black}{initial}} -- (0,3) node[above]{\textcolor{black}{final}} node[midway,right]{$C_1$};

		\node[blue] at (1.2,1.5) {$C_3$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-20pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

work by gravitational force is path independent

for example, same work is done via path $C_1$, $C_2$ and $C_3$

so gravitational force is conservative, G.P.E. can be defined

as a consequence, gain or loss in G.P.E. only depends on the difference in initial and final position of the object

if there is no other conservative force acting on a body apart from gravitational force, it follows that change in total energy of an object equals the net work done by all forces excluding gravity





\subsubsection{conservation of energy}

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{the law of conservation of energy} states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but can only transform from one form into another while the total amount is always constant  \index{conservation of energy}
\end{ilight}

in absence of any non-conservative force, sum of a body's kinetic energy and potential energies, or the total mechanical energy,  is constant, this is also a law of conservation


\example{For an object falling from rest due to gravity, if air resistance is negligible, what is its speed when it has fallen through a distance of $h$? }

\solc
\begin{equation*}
	\text{G.P.E loss} \,\,\, = \,\,\, \text{K.E gain} \RA mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \RA v=\sqrt{2gh} \teoe
\end{equation*}


\example{A marble is projected vertically upwards with an initial velocity $u$. The average resistive force acting is $f$. How do you determine the maximum height reached by the marble?}

\sol $\text{K.E. loss} \,\,\, = \,\,\, \text{G.P.E. gain} \,\,\, + \,\,\, \text{energy loss due to resistance}$
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{1}{2}mu^2 - 0 = mgH_\tmax + f H_\tmax \RA  H_\tmax = \frac{mu^2}{2(mg+f)}\teoe

\example{A \emph{ballistic pendulum} is a device used to measure the speeds of fast-moving bullets. It consists of a large block of wood of mass $M$, suspended from two long light strings. A bullet of mass $m$ is fired into the block, and the block and bullet combination swings upward. If the centre of mass rises a vertical distance $h$, what is the initial speed $u$ of the bullet?}

\sol as bullet enters block, combined momentum is conserved:
\begin{equation*}
	mu = (M+m)v \RA v = \frac{mu}{M+m}

when the system swings upward, K.E. transforms into G.P.E. but total energy is conserved:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2}(M+m)v^2 = (M+g)gh \RA v = \sqrt{2gh}
\end{equation*}

putting the two equations together, we find: $ u = \left(1+\frac{M}{m}\right)\sqrt{2gh} $ \eoe








\subsection{power}

to describe how fast work is done, we introduce the notion of power

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{power} is defined as the work done per unit time: $\boxed{P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}}$  \index{power}
\end{ilight}

\cmt unit of power: $[P]  = \frac{[W]}{[t]} = \text{J s}^{-1} = \text{W (watt)}$

if one joule of work is done in one second, the power is one \keypoint{watt}

\cmt $P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}$ gives the \emph{average} power during in a period of time $\Delta t$

to find the \emph{instantaneous} power at a particular moment, we have
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} = \frac{F \Delta s}{\Delta t} \RA \boxed{P=Fv}
\end{equation*}

\example{There are 150 steps to the top of a tower, and the average height of each step is 25 cm. It takes a man of 72 kg two minutes to run up all the steps. What is his average power?}

	P = \frac{\Delta E_p}{\Delta t} = \frac{mg \Delta h}{\Delta t} = \frac{72\times9.81\times (150\times0.25)}{120} \RA P \approx 221 \text{ W} \teoe

\eqyskip\solc\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{\Delta E_k}{\Delta t} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}\Delta m v^2}{\Delta t} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \rho \Delta V v^2}{\Delta t} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \rho A \Delta x v^2}{\Delta t} \RA P = \frac{1}{2} \rho A v^3

\example{A ship is cruising a a constant speed of $15 \mps$. The total resistive force acting is 9000 N. What is the output power of this ship?}

\sol constant speed so equilibrium between driving force and resistive force

\example{A car of mass $800 kg$ accelerates from rest on a horizontal road. Suppose the engine provides a constant power of 24000 W, and the resistive force can be given by $f=16v$, where $v$ is the speed of the car in$\mps$. (a) What is the acceleration of the car when it is travelling at $15\mps$? (b) What happens to the car if it maintains this driving power?}

\sol equation of motion for the car is: $ F_\text{net} = F - f = ma \RA \frac{P}{v} - \alpha v = ma $

at $v=15\mps$: $\frac{24000}{15} - 16\times15 = 800a \RA a=1.7\mpss $

as car's velocity $v$ increases, driving force $F=\frac{P}{v}$ decreases, resistive force $f=\alpha v$ increases

so resultant force will decrease, the car will accelerate at a decreasing acceleration

eventually it reaches an equilibrium state where $F=f$, the car then travels at constant speed $v_t$
\begin{equation*}
F=f \RA \frac{P}{v_t} = \alpha v_t \RA \frac{24000}{v_t} = 16v_t \RA v_t \approx 38.7\mps \teoe

\subsection{efficiency}

efficiency of a system is given by: $\text{efficiency} = \frac{\text{useful energy output}}{\text{total energy input}} $, or $\boxed{\eta = \frac{W_\text{useful}}{W_\text{total}}}$

since $\Delta W = P \Delta t$, efficiency can also be evaluated in terms of power: $\boxed{\eta = \frac{P_\text{useful}}{P_\text{total}}}$ \index{efficiency}

	\eta = \frac{\Delta E_p}{\Delta E_\text{in}} = \frac{\Delta m g h}{P_\text{in} \Delta t} = \frac{1500\times9.81\times8.0}{3000\times60} \RA \eta \approx 65.4 \% \teoe

\example{Water flows into a turbine from a reservoir at a vertical distance of 70 m above. The water flows through the turbine at a rate of 2500 kg per minute. What is the output power of the turbine if it is 85\% efficient?}

\solc\begin{equation*}
P_\text{out} = \eta P_\text{in} = \eta \frac{\Delta E_p}{\Delta t} = \eta \frac{\Delta m g h}{\Delta t} = 85\% \times \frac{2500 \times 9.81 \times 70}{60} \RA P_\text{out} \approx 2.43 \times 10^4 \text{ W}
