## Introduction

This is a set of very concise lecture notes written for [CIE AS-level Physics](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-international-as-and-a-level-physics-9702/) (syllabus code 9702). Presumably the target audience of the notes are students studying the relevant course.

If you spot any errors, please let me know.

## How to Use

Master file: a-level-physics.tex

The master file references the included chapters, each chapter is in separated .tex file as suggested by file names.

My default compiler is PdfLaTeX, which is recommended. XeLaTeX also works fine for me. I am not sure about other compilers.

If you are a student, you might simply want to [download the compiled .pdf file](https://github.com/yuhao-yang-cy/asphysics/blob/master/asphysics.pdf) for your own use.
